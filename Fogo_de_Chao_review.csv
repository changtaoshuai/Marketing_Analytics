1,"The atmosphere is very different under COVID.   A server will bring salad bar items into your plate.  You pick which meat choices a d they bring small, precut portions to you.  It‚Äôs still all you can eat, food quality seems the same as before.  But the whole feel is very different and less special.",4," November 27, 2020"
2,Meat is not good. Food doesn‚Äôt taste as good. Paid 90$/ person for a not good food. Doesn‚Äôt worth the money.,3," November 26, 2020"
3,"We love Fogo. The service and staff are always wonderful. They are really trying hard to make the best out of the covid situation and restrictions. We‚Äôve spent more than a handful of holiday meals here. The tables felt a little cramped this time, which I was surprised by. The food was great. Will return again.",5," November 26, 2020"
4,"Despite the recent reviews I saw on google, the food was great. Everything at the salad bar was great, I think my favorite was the chickpea salad. What I was disappointed about is though, after maybe 4-5 times they weren‚Äôt stopping by our table for the meat service. It wasn‚Äôt like there weren‚Äôt enough servers, they just kept walking by us without asking if we wanted some. I was waiting for about 20 minutes without anything to eat before I decided to go back to the salad bar. Servers and bussers kept asking if we were finished with our food because our plates were empty for so long. It was bit disappointing but the food itself was very nice!",3," November 24, 2020"
5,"I always feel rushed by the staff, it seems like they don‚Äôt want to be there. The steak portions were definitely smaller of what we used to. When we first arrived there was a congregation of staff members at the front desk (not safe at this covid crisis) the. We preceded to be seated at a table away from the beautiful view of the window, they said that section was closed. They handed out a piece of paper to be filled out by us we had to specify what kind of meats we wanted, it was pointless because they brought the opposite of what we wanted. We had a bacon allergy and that they brought us chicken wrapped in bacon. More than once. During lunch they kept offering some grilled pineapple that we didn‚Äôt want it at all. The picahna was burnt on the outside and cut very very thin and too much fat. Overall experience was disappointing, our side dishes were  cold and never refreshed or served hot. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be back again",4," November 19, 2020"
6,Phenomenal meal and service.  Adapted well to covid rules.,5," November 14, 2020"
7,This restaurant was really good! I would just say that I feel like the restaurant did not do good with COVID! tables were too close and there were so many people,4," November 14, 2020"
8,Had a party of 8. Food was delicious but service slowed down after only a few plates of food. Overall still a good experience,3," November 14, 2020"
9,"Very good, tasty food, nice atmoshere, but also very expensive.",5," November 13, 2020"
10,Staff was informative and attentive,4," November 8, 2020"
11,"Fogo is always a great place for meat lovers, I‚Äôve always enjoyed my visit to other locations and now this one as well. I wish their cuts were more tender, as it‚Äôs usually my experience, I do however understand that we are under a pandemic and it is challenging to procure ingredients with the still-in-business purveyors and that represents a though situation for everybody involved, nevertheless the staff managed to more than make up for that little detail, thank you",4," November 7, 2020"
12,"Good concept, maybe better value without a pandemic. Tables are quite close, salad bar is not accessible without waiter assistance. Meats do come quite regularly but you want to be careful not to say yes to all of them, otherwise you get full quickly.",3," October 31, 2020"
13,The experience has deteriorated significantly from the last time I went to dine there.  It doesn‚Äôt warrant the $60 per person price tag.  Out dated and the salad bar was reduced to greens and some cheese with very limited options. Very disappointed.,3," October 31, 2020"
14,"Service was good, though adjusted given the pandemic, guests are still seated too close to each other. <br/>Good meat selection but mostly medium rare and even well done. Salad selection is really good. <br/>They gave us desserts for the anniversary &amp; birthday we were celebrating - very nice gesture! Much appreciated!",4," October 31, 2020"
15,Food shmacks servers awesome social distancing prime,5," October 29, 2020"
16,"Service was perfect, and the COVID-19 safety precautions were Both effective and non-disruptive to our dining experience.",5," October 27, 2020"
17,This was our second visit to Fogo de Chao and the food was excellent once again! Waitstaff were kind and very attentive.,5," October 26, 2020"
18,Birthday date. Nice time,5," October 23, 2020"
19,"Covid procedures for Buffet were very well done.  Might even consider keeping the look and ask, but server touches model going forward.   I did miss the table-side carvings and green/red cards.  Just not the same taking pre-sliced meat from a plate.  Servers were very attentive, and caring.",5," October 22, 2020"
20,Awesome experiance!  My recommendation is to skip lunch and bring your appetite to Fogo de Chao and you wont be disappointed!,5," October 10, 2020"
21,"So we are in a pandemic, and I kept this in mind.  we were seated at the back of the restaurant, it was nice and quite.<br/>Our server was very nice, unfortunately we couldnt understand a word she was saying, with or without a mask.  Her entire focus for the first 10 minutes was to upsell, even after we politely responded no.  She delivered cheese rolls with no plates, utensils or napkins..  We had to ask.<br/><br/>We then found out they work in teams, her teammate was Joey Wow, that's right couldn't make that up.  He was great and took over from there.  He was spot on with everything.<br/><br/>As for the food, the market buffet offered a nice variety.  Now for the meats, what Fogo is known for.  They offer 13 different meats, we were offered the following;<br/>cheese 2x, parmesan pork 2x, tenderloin 2x, pork sausage 1x, lamb roast 2x, lamb rib 2x, sirloin 2x and chix wrap in bacon 1x.   No beef ribs, pork ribs, rib eye, no regular chicken or picahna.  When they arrived to the table there were only small slices of meat and very few of them, as they couldnt even serve everyone at the table.  What was happening is they started at the front of the room and worked their way back, which is fine, however those of us sitting in the back got the scraps.  I called over a floor manager and he quickly corrected the issue.<br/><br/>Overall we enjoyed the food and the service, its quite clear that covid has changed the way everyone has to operate.  We will be back, just wanted to share our experience.",3," October 10, 2020"
22,The restaurant is only worth it if you are going to stuff yourself.,3," October 10, 2020"
23,"excellent service, excellent food, over all a great choice !",5," October 9, 2020"
24,"Our waiter Joe-Wow was absolutely amazing. I have never been happier with a server here. My girlfriend and I frequent here often and we came for a friends birthday. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better waiter for the first time. He was friendly, personable, and very funny. I will specifically be coming back sooner than planned just to visit him.",5," October 5, 2020"
25,The layout doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of privacy at your table which is my only complaint. The food was fantastic and the service matched.,4," October 2, 2020"
26,Birthday. Really nice food. Kept coming with more food than we could handle. Steaks were rare,5," October 2, 2020"
27,"They adapted really well to the new really and I felt safe, yet not loosing the experience I was hoping for when coming to a Brazilian steakhouse. In fact I think I prefer the way of serving the meats. Great job!",5," October 2, 2020"
28,Meats didn‚Äôt seem fresh. Requested medium on the meats kept getting well done. Only positive is Drinks were really good.,3," September 26, 2020"
29,Don't eat for several days beforehand. Also be sure to confront the,4," September 26, 2020"

32,"Go hungry!  Great experience, wonderful, creative food and the best beef we ever tasted!",5," September 23, 2020"
33,Great! All the servers were nice and professional. The food was outstanding. All the measures in place to make sure the restaurant was clean were taken with extreme care.,5," September 21, 2020"
34,Not my fav place in Boston. Concept is cool and great variety of meets but not cooked the way I would have preferred. It was just ok.,3," September 19, 2020"
35,"So bad service I will never come back here again, their was a nice mangier woman their she good take care of the customer this why I do a business meal here , now so bad stuff and mangier I will not recommend this place anymore",1," September 15, 2020"
36,It was me and my sisters 22nd birthday it was super nice and fun they was super nice and made our night super special for me and my sister highly recommend!!,5," September 14, 2020"
37,"As we entered the restaurant everything thing was good and very organized,it was my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday üéÇ they made her feel very special .",5," September 12, 2020"
38,Food was excellent and loved the marketplace. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Liked the option to ala carte dinner such as sea bass.,5," September 12, 2020"
39,"great service, and great quality of meat. The manager was nice to stop by every table and ask our need",5," September 12, 2020"
40,Not the same as before covid19 <br/>They are serving very small portions of foods and there is a long delay between one order and the next one,3," September 7, 2020"
41,"I don't know if I've had a worse experience at a restaurant in the last 10 years. We foolishly came here for our first wedding anniversary and got ripped off for $200 for a couple of pieces of overcooked, cold beef. The waiters kept coming around and around with their cold, well-done steak and it literally took 35 minutes to fulfill our request for medium rare filet mignon, which came in the form of 2 tiny slices each. The waitress, Bruna, spent the entire evening trying to up-sell us to the seafood tower, the shrimp cocktail, anything to add to our bill instead of inform us of what was already included in the $60/person ""experience"" we had signed up for. Fogo de Chao should be ASHAMED of themselves for the pathetic, cold, overcooked offering they call dinner, the prices they charge, and the impersonal and pathetic experience they offer their customers. I'm literally at a loss at how they are even still in business. This is one restaurant I really wish had not survived the pandemic because they do not deserve whatever following they have. Having spent $200 on nothing, here's a photo of them misspelling an anniversary greeting as ""Happy Firth Anniversary."" Thanks so much for ruining our day!",1," September 7, 2020"
42,Amazing date place,5," September 6, 2020"
43,The quality of food was very poor. Service was slow. All out meats came cold to the tabke. Maybe it‚Äôs due to Covid-19 new setup but we were very disappointed and will not return for a long time.,1," September 5, 2020"
44,with the new regulation the restaurant lost his appeal on Brazilian BBQ. Understand that this is in force by the state regulation but the quality was affected....<br/>obrigado,4," September 4, 2020"
45,"Different feel, given COVID, but they did a nice job of trying to make it work.  Food always good.  Service always good as well.  Hopefully we will someday be back to the way things used to be.  It made for a better dining experience.",3," September 3, 2020"
46,It was a great experience!,5," August 29, 2020"
47,Food was amazing! Staff was very on point and friendly! Great vibe there,5," August 29, 2020"
48,It just was a not the same as before.,2," August 29, 2020"
49,"Nice job re-adjusting to these circumstances. Each diner going up to the buffet was given wait staff to walk around and serve them. The overall service was very good and the food was as good as ever, including the drinks. I hope they can make it through this time. They are one of our favorite places in Boston.",5," August 29, 2020"
50,Great service and the steak was really good.  Glad we didn‚Äôt have to wait for the service,5," August 28, 2020"
51,Was a lovely evening. A little busier than expected but service and food was amazing.,5," August 28, 2020"
52,Went because it was dine out week have been there for the full menu before. I find that the alcohol prices are very high the quality of the food is excellent for the dine out menu it was supposed to include desert and the key lime pie was very very small and skimpy. And my four favorite cuts of meat or Not Included and the special but the food was very good I thought they did a great job with the buffet and handling it but the room that I was in the tables were way too close together they were not 6 feet apart that made me very afraid,3," August 28, 2020"
53,Great hospitality. Food was awesome!,5," August 27, 2020"
54,"For being my first time I will say my friends &amp; I are very pleased at the service we received. The food was delicious and the drinks were fantastic üòâ.  We are pleased that this establishment followed Covid guidelines, someone to serve us every step of the way. To have a assortment of foods to choose from was amazing, even on the Dine Out Boston menu we had the full experience. Thank you for great customer service",5," August 27, 2020"
55,Amazing food and service. We had a great experience.,5," August 26, 2020"
56,"This was our first time back to a restaurant since COVID and it was perfect, we will be going back ASAP!",5," August 26, 2020"
57,The experience was great. I have been there a few times and nothings changed. Great service and food. Covid has them doing things a little differently but doesn't take away from the regular experience much.,5," August 24, 2020"
58,My son and I were celebrating our birthdays and it was absolutely fantastic. Our main server Maria was great but then all the other were too. Great service. I can't wait to go back.,5," August 24, 2020"
59,Solid restaurant going strong for many years. Very good adaptation to post Covid world with precautions at the salad bar and several tables kept empty because of social distancing,4," August 22, 2020"
60,"It was a cool experience, however they did not honor the dine out Boston promotion they had so we ended up paying full price. I probably would plan to come back had they let us pay the promotion. <br/><br/>Salad bar was alright 2/5<br/>Meats 4/5<br/>Drinks- none<br/>Cheese bread-5/5<br/>Plantain and yucca-4/5<br/>Service-3/5<br/><br/>Our main waitress was very attentive and courteous however the waiters with meats were no where to be found for 20 minutes. Found it weird they would look at our table and see we had nothing on our plates but would just pass us. Overall it‚Äôs an experience you can cross off your list but probably won‚Äôt go there again.",3," August 22, 2020"
61,It is unfortunate but the quality of the meet is not what used to be. Don‚Äôt know if because of the COVID situation but very slow service and poor quality.,3," August 21, 2020"
62,"Love it, even with the COVID regulations!!! I need more bacon in my life!",5," August 20, 2020"
63,Birthday celebration. We had a good time. Food was delicious. Customer service was definitely a 5 star!!!,5," August 20, 2020"
64,Food was amazing! A must try! Service was so friendly and accommodating!,5," August 20, 2020"
65,"IMO, Fogo should not be open as they physically cannot provide the true experience during a pandemic. Certain foods were not available, and in addition to having meat brought to your table- EVERYTHING was brought to your table. This made for a quite annoying dinner. Unable to take portions you would like as well as enjoy a decent conversation with waiters constantly approaching your table. Staff were very nice, but this was a waste.",2," August 18, 2020"
66,"Absolutely delicious. A little odd, under the no buffet bar protocols, but it worked. Great service. Prob a bit overpriced in comparison to some equally good, less fancy churrascar√≠as in town.",4," August 18, 2020"
67,We had a great time . Service was excellent.,5," August 15, 2020"
68,"Everyone knows what Fogo offers, so no need to go into the actual food or ingredients.<br/><br/>But, in this COVID era, my family and I felt totally safe.  Every precaution was taken.  Cleanliness was evident throughout the establishment, and the experience was very similar and maybe even more personable.<br/><br/>I would not hesitate to recommend you visiting Fogo during this time.",5," August 15, 2020"
69,"As always, Jonathan and Paulo were amazing- we got to meet the manager Chantelle (??? I think!?) and our waitress was a young blonde who was also amazing and I‚Äôm kicking myself for not getting her name! But please give this amazing staff the props they deserve! I‚Äôm sure we will see you VERY soon!",5," August 12, 2020"
70,COVID hit the away Fogo de chao serve they food. Service is always great. I think the rugs smell a little be.  I high recommend Fogo de Chao.,5," August 12, 2020"
71,Very hospitable and amazing food!,5," August 9, 2020"
72,Thought we were going to have a fabulous experience but did not!the servers were gushing over another table as if to believe they were someone special by constantly serving them and cleaning their table. They stuff you on the salad and side bar items then we only saw chicken wrapped in bacon and sausage. Had to ask for meat too many times and was forgotten by wait staff. Had to literally beg for the beef and waited for the grilled bananas we never received. The man in the beige suit played stupid to our concerns yet the woman manager was very nice and took one meal off our bill. I do not recommend this place at all. Too expensive and not worth the value.,1," August 8, 2020"
73,Jonathan the gaucho and Paulo are our favorites and treat us like royalty! We go here a lot and they always take amazing care of us! The whole staff is second to none!,5," August 7, 2020"
74,The quality of the meat was good. However the buffet bar is not open during Covid which is understandable but the price remains the same. Hard to justify charging the same price by offering a reduced experience. Wish I had been told about this before booking.,3," August 6, 2020"
75,Great dinner!!! All steak lovers welcome!! It was a 10/10,5," August 4, 2020"
76,Fantastic food - large variety of meats. Covid friendly bringing the salad bar to you.,5," July 25, 2020"
77,"Unfortunately it felt rushed. Once we sat down and our server came to our table, the food service started and they came continuously. It seemed almost impossible to enjoy some food before they were offering more to us at the table. It would have been more enjoyable if they slowed down and provided a little break in between food offerings.",4," July 25, 2020"
78,"Such a great birthday dinner, everyone was great and the food was amazing",5," July 19, 2020"
79,They should let you take what‚Äôs left on plate ands stop bringing so much food,2," July 19, 2020"
80,"During quarantine, the restaurant is open but the 'market table' is closed rendering the whole experience quite poor value.",2," July 18, 2020"
81,"Great food and service, I will definitely dine again",5," July 13, 2020"
82,It was so easy to make a reservation.  <br/><br/>When dinner started I had to say it was insanely amazing. The staff taking care of the food were so attentive. I felt spoiled. The food was delicious and considering it was our first time it was a great experience!<br/><br/>They have valet service saves the aggravation of looking for parking.<br/><br/> I highly recommend it you haven‚Äôt been here,5," July 11, 2020"
83,Great food and great service! Food was coming to the table every other minute! Can‚Äôt wait to go again!,5," July 11, 2020"
84,Excellent!!!,5," July 11, 2020"
85,"Fogo does a fantastic job every time we go there. During this most recent trip, the staff had implemented a number of new safety measures and social distancing precautions due to COVID-19.<br/><br/>Despite the restrictions, the servers still put on an incredible service and made us feel safe and welcome. As always, the food and drink were second-to-none, and the value for the meal is definitely there. <br/><br/>For anyone looking to enjoy a relaxed meal out, even during these crazy times we are living in, I would recommend Fogo 100%",5," July 7, 2020"
86,Our favorite Brazilian Steakhouse has been closed. With a trip to Boston we took an opportunity to try Fogo de Chao and we were extremely pleased! The staff were great! The food was great! Looking forward to our next visit!,5," July 6, 2020"
87,I loved it! It was my first time there and it was amazing!,5," July 3, 2020"
88,An amazing experience.  The waiters were knowledgeable and really on top of service.  The food was some of the best I've had in Boston,5," June 26, 2020"
89,The first night they reopened and the staff are doing their best to adapt. Everyone was very attentive and the food was of the same quality.,5," June 26, 2020"
90,Great service and unbelievably good food,5," March 14, 2020"
91,Went during restaurant week. The meat selection is unbeatable. The servers are busy but still trying to be attentive. I like the dessert menu too.,5," March 12, 2020"
92,"Fogo is always a good bang for your buck, but Restaurant Week is an extra savings. For only $38, they serve you the whole menu of meat (minus a few specialty cuts), plus the salad/cheese bar and hot sides like pao de queijo, plantains, polenta fries, and mashed potatoes. You also get a half serving of dessert! The food is always so tasty and service is always fast. One thing to note is that the ‚Äúbrigadeiro‚Äù is actually a chocolate mouse/gelatin cake and not traditional brigadeiro. Slightly disappointing. Overall I had a great time and enjoyed introducing my BF to the magic that is Brazilian steakhouses i.e. unlimited steak, pork, and chicken served table side from a sword.",4," March 11, 2020"
93,"Everything was amazing about the experience except for the hostess who was extremely unprofessional to my friend about the high chair/child situation. We had mentioned that our reservation changed to add a child and she disregarded the information at the host stand when we told her and proceeded to bring us to the table which 6 chairs were. When we informed her that we needed a high chair she said "" for who?"" and we stated we had a child with us and she then responded with ""oh she's tall enough she'll be fine"". My friend at that point told her that she would still like a high chair so the child could be more restricted and not run around while we had dinner and then the hostesses still at this time didn't listen to anything and try to take a chair away in which we had to explain to her again that we needed the 6 chairs but just simply wanted a high chair for the child. Besides the unprofessional hostess, the food was amazing, the service was very good and we enjoyed our time. However, the beginning was a little upsetting because of the hostess.",4," March 10, 2020"
94,"Even with Reservation there was about a 10min wait, due to it being restaurant week I believe. Servers and management were polite, food came around every couple minutes. The lamb or fillet didn‚Äôt come around as often.",4," March 8, 2020"
95,We had a fantastic time.  Delicious food. Great services.,5," March 8, 2020"
96,"Food was very good as always.  We didn't see much of our waitperson, and if we weren't paying attention we worked have been significantly overcharged but that was remedied.",4," March 8, 2020"
97,The food was amazing my husband couldn't start raving about the food,4," March 7, 2020"
98,"Didn‚Äôt enjoy last nights dinner; it felt filthy and rushed; every time the servers were coming by with meats and their knives we were scared to get hurt; food was so so , salad bar was lacking food; drinks it good and over priced <br/>Not sure I will return in a long time",3," March 7, 2020"
99,The food was delectable. Cooked to perfection. Plenty of waitstaff available at anytime. The ambiance was appealing and the noise level was low. Plenty of room between tables. Overall wonderful experience!,5," March 7, 2020"
100,Horrible experience. They didn‚Äôt care about serving us. They only got our drinks order in the beginning. We had to hunt our server down to order our meal. And waited 1hour and 30 min to then realize they were never going to bring our order. Never came by again to refill our drinks or anything. Will never return and I highly do not recommend this location.,1," March 6, 2020"
101,"Food was good. Had not been before, and the style of service was a bit confusing. Was fairly busy, server explained extremely quickly and left. Took a while to get the check.",3," March 6, 2020"
102,food was good not as great as before could be because the place was packed.  We have to wait 25 min. even with a reservation.,4," March 6, 2020"
103,Wait time was almost 30 minutes beyond our reservation time.,3," March 6, 2020"
104,"Everything was wonderful. The food was delicious, the staff were amazing. We had a great time. Would definitely go back.",5," March 5, 2020"
105,"Unfortunately we unknowingly went during restaurant week and were treated as such. This was the second time going first time was fantastic, this time not so much. Staff seemed annoyed as if we were not going to tip well. We were a table of four and were not anticipating a discounted venue when arriving",3," March 3, 2020"
106,"Went during restaurant week which lets you dine from the full menu (with some minor exceptions) for almost half the regular price including dessert, making for a great value. As always the food here is great and the service outstanding. Eat as much as you‚Äôd like from the wonderful market table, and receive continuous table-side service of sides and meats. One of my favorite spots in Boston!",5," March 3, 2020"
107,"Reserved a table but Waited for 30 min. Need to remind the waiter our cocktails and expresso that we ordered. Disappointed of the service, Too many people, noisy but at least, food was good.",3," March 1, 2020"
108,Meat is overdone. service is slow and tables are too close.,1," March 1, 2020"
109,"Disappointing brunch. All I saw was a omelet station and ready waffles. <br/>Although the meat is Brazilian style, every other selection is not Brazilian. Their cheese rolls are not the Brazilian way either. <br/>Overall, the value is not there.",3," March 1, 2020"
110,"We have been going to Fogo for years; this was our last meal at this restaurant. The service was awful; we were ignored throughout the entire meal; and, the food was overcooked. I am upset that we had such a bad experience because we always look forward to eating here. No one even mentioned that this was our anniversary...",1," February 29, 2020"
111,"Took 20 minutes to be seated. Food was great- wish that we knew all the options that were coming- some we got twice and some new ones turned up just as we were feeling full but those were some of our favorites, just wish we had had more room for them. Servers were very attentive with sides and clean plates.",4," February 29, 2020"
112,"Food is great but service was a little slow when trying to get drinks, dessert and check",3," February 29, 2020"
113,I had higher expectation coming from previous visits to this restaurant.  The food was downgraded (not a lot of options as before) and the meat tasted like rubber. The service was extremely bad as far as the people who I interacted with.  Gentlemen who worked there were nice. Will I come back? No way!!,1," February 29, 2020"
114,"Such a different experience from prior visits. The staff was inattentive and indifferent. There was a napkin on the floor as well as scraps of bread, lettuce and other food on the floor around our table when we were seated. At those prices, there should be ample staff making sure service and cleanliness are not overlooked. I will not return.",2," February 22, 2020"
115,Food was delicious! We enjoyed the many meat options that float around for table service as well as the bread.,5," February 22, 2020"
116,We've been to Fogo de Chao many times but this location seems to be a bit skimpy with their meats.  There were several times when we sat around waiting  and waiting and waiting for someone to bring out some meats.  The restaurant was not that busy and they had plenty of servers but did not want to accommodate customers.  Not sure what happened but we had to ask for them to bring out some meats for everyone.  What a pity!!!!  Poor management?,2," February 22, 2020"

126,Great food and atmosphere. It was  a good place for a Valentine's Dinner Date,5," February 16, 2020"
127,"Food is always great but the service is lacking. We got inundated with meat options when we first sat but when we decided to take a break, it stopped coming. We waited a while and even asked but still did not get any grill service after that. We were also supposed to get valentines coupons for each couple (we were 3 couples) but did not get any. They will apparently mail them to us, which resulted from me calling the restaurant and explaining the situation. We also had some deals emailed to us that we tried to ask about when paying and were rudely told that we should have asked before sitting down, which we did not know and even so did not need to be scolded for just because we asked. Overall, bad service, very busy, great food though.",3," February 15, 2020"
128,Food was mediocre for price and the dining experience was more like a cruise ship buffet.,2," February 15, 2020"
129,Great service and unreal story. Five $20 bills dropped out of my pocket during dinner. I didn‚Äôt realize I had lost the money until after we left the restaurant. I called about 20 minutes after we left to ask if anyone had turned in money. Unfortunately nobody had. About 30 minutes later my phone rang and they told me the money was found by a restaurant employee.<br/><br/>So many great people in this world.<br/><br/>Great end to a great night.,5," February 15, 2020"
130,"Busy valentine's  day dinner. I've had a better experience here. 2 of the meats were severely overcooked and dry (parm crusted pork was 1, cant remember the other). The food on the bar was great, it looked and tastes fresh. The cocktails were good as well. We didnt require much but felt I shouldn't have to ask for more sides when ours was gone.  We will give it another shot soon and use the b1g1 coupon they handed to diners over this weekend.",3," February 14, 2020"

135,"They filled the floor with tables to maximize profit on Valentine's Day. It created what I am sure was fire code violation. We finally got the lamb chops to come our way and they were overcooked. Nice for a visit, but they did little to entice us to return",3," February 14, 2020"

139,"This was just an okay experience.  The food was good but not great.  The meat was just okay and much of it was overcooked.  We liked the bacon wrapped chicken the best but the picanha, sirloin, filet mignon were not very flavorful.  the sides buffet was fine. Many choices and it was okay but nothing memorable.  the dessert - tres leches cake- was way too sweet and the dulce de leche sauce on top was too much.  The service was prompt. It feels like a hotel restaurant.  For the price, it was not worth it.",3," February 9, 2020"
140,"Service was terrible, wanted to order a simple ginger ale, the staff proceeded to explain they had ginger in a can ... they had no idea what ginger ale was! Then they charged us for bottle water at 7.50 each ...won‚Äôt be back",1," February 9, 2020"

144,This was the first time I had been here for their lunch option. We decided to upgrade and have 1 meat option per person. It was MORE than enough food for a lunch during the work day.

150,"Fantastic, filling, and delicious!",5," February 1, 2020"
151,"This restaurant did not quite measure up to other Brazilian steak house experiences.  The service was not good.  We had to ask for another glass of water.  We had to ask to order wine.  Dirty plates were not removed so we went to the salad bar to get clean ones.  Part of our group jumped right in to having meat served, and that was done promptly and repeatedly.  When the rest of us were ready for meat, the servers were not exactly prompt.  Maybe servers were out sick.   The salad bar was lovely, but not spectacular like others I've encountered.  It's a nice restaurant, don't get me wrong, but the service marred the experience.  I will not be in a hurry to return.",3," February 1, 2020"
152,"When my family in town this has always been one of our favorite places to eat. No complaints about the food still, but service was rather poor. Considering that place was almost empty by the time we came in waiting for water or mashed potatoes for extended periods of time just is not right. I thought you bill yourself as premium restaurant. Service in a need of major improvements.",3," January 30, 2020"

157,Fun dinner for my birthday,4," January 25, 2020"
158,"We felt rushed from the second we got there and it wasn't busy at all. We had five different waiters come to our table at a time. The food was good but there was no variety, the same kinds of meats kept coming out.  It was way too expensive for the experience we had.",2," January 25, 2020"
159,Great food! The food bar is fantastic and you could make a whole meal of just that. Add the meats and you will be more than sated. The papaya dessert was so good! And you can get just the food bar for $15 at lunchtime. Can‚Äôt beat it!,5," January 23, 2020"

166,Poor selection of meats. Very basic. The restaurant was freezing cold. Felt like they kept the door open during a -10 night. The service was very good and I appreciated the manager coming to our table to check on us. I wouldn't go back if I had the choice.,3," January 18, 2020"

171,"The guys annual holiday lunch, an events that has happened here for the past 5 years. The food is always great and the service impeccable. We did notice a slight change in the salad bar and skewers from previous years, slightly less offerings. They also offer different options for lunch, the full menu or a reduced menu. Don‚Äôt know why but we always opt for the full Monty.",4," January 13, 2020"
172,Food was so good! Received a complementary birthday dessert for my boyfriend. Would definitely visit again with group of friends.,5," January 11, 2020"
173,"This is a great choice if you like meat and can't decide what cut to order. Bring your appetite, but prepare to be overwhelmed by the choices. <br/><br/>It is an especially good restaurant if you are taking your hungry college student for a meal not prepared in a dining hall.<br/><br/>It's also a good choice for brunch.",5," January 11, 2020"
174,"We are very disappointed about the restaurant we went with you along time ago then we return back for birthday party. Overall  there were only five different meat came and repeated all the time. our server was not friendly at all, he even didn‚Äôt want to recommend additional drinks  that they couldn‚Äôt make war provide me a list of more than 2  tequila selection. I won‚Äôt  go back and I will tell my friends is not worth for your money that you paid.",1," January 11, 2020"

177,"The service was excellent.  Loved the quality of the meat.  It was my daughter‚Äôs birthday and I had noted it on the reservation. I also mentioned it to the hostess when we arrived. I had expected that the restaurant would have acknowledged the birthday. Nothing was said. When I had done the same thing at another high end steak house, there was a single rose given to the birthday girl, a birthday card and a glass of champagne offered.  I was surprised  that nothing was done.   Also, many other Brazilian steakhouses have a desert buffet. There was nothing here.",5," January 5, 2020"

180,"We were celebrating our son‚Äôs birthday. Food, service, atmosphere all very good. At the end, they surprised us with a molten chocolate cake with a candle &amp; sang. We did not expect that! It was very thoughtful. The Market Table (buffet) was outstanding. The continuous selection of carved meats freshly sliced &amp; served at our table were tasty and cooked very well. For small eaters (or non-meat eaters) the Market Table is perfectly satisfying. We would recommend and we would return to Fogo de Chao.",5," January 2, 2020"

184,We have been coming there for years and in fact had a very large celebration a few years ago because the food and service were always 5 star.  The service still is BUT the food especially the meat is not.  sadly another restaurant that has lost their way on quality.,3," December 31, 2019"
185,"The food is really good, especially the beef is of very high quality. However, the service of the waiter (not the server of meat) was poor. It was our first time visiting this restaurant, so we didn't know how the service usually goes. The waiter was talking so fast and so unclear that we couldn't understand even after she explained the rule. The plates supposed to be changed regularly, but we couldn't find our waiter when we needed her; after she finally took away the dirty plates, she needed an additional reminder from us to give us a new plate. A restaurant serving such quality food should pair with thoughtful service.",4," December 30, 2019"
186,Been there over 20 times and never had a bad experience. The utmost of class.,5," December 28, 2019"
187,"Great service and food! Salad bar had a good variety, however I wish there were more options for fruit. Also dessert isn‚Äôt included in the buffet portion and is a separate charge. Overall, beautiful space and exceptional dinner.",4," December 28, 2019"
188,Enjoyed the great service as well as the food.  The varied meats were all uniquely flavored and seasoned to perfection. Just enough vegetables at the buffet to create a well rounded healthy lunch. The candied bacon alone was worth the trip!,5," December 28, 2019"

197,"They made every effort to make it a beautiful Christmas Eve lunch for us. One server in particular was incredibly thoughtful to our needs (my husband wanted chicken and he made sure that the chicken was brought to our table first out of the kitchen). That same waiter realized the occasion was for my birthday and, without asking, provided a birthday flan and sang happy birthday. Lovely experience, as always. Will be back.",5," December 24, 2019"

203,"This is a great restaurant chain, but under no circumstances should you come to the Boston spot on a Friday or a Saturday even if you think you have a reservation. Nice people working here but we waited 45 minutes for our reserved table ; it was pandemonium with people waiting everywhere out of the door and spilling out into the rain. We waited at the table another 20mins for drinks when seated and finally left after an hour without having had our fill to eat because there were not enough servers and not enough meat!! Just simply got tired of it all and decided to not come back.",2," December 13, 2019"

Great seats to people watch on this rainy evening.<br/>I had my veggies for lunch and was here (my second time in the past couple of years) only for the protein.<br/>As we were devouring a pile of yummy smoked salmon, roasted sweet potatoes and some feijoada (meh) from the Market Table, we got our drinks (a strong Mango Habanero and a Caipirina).<br/>Time to flip our cards to Green!<br/>The servers were attentive and came by very frequently. <br/>The cuts were generous and cooked to our liking.<br/>One of them even remembered my quest for lamb (which hadn't come out in a while) and came by with a hot, steamy skewer of freshly cooked chops.<br/>About an hour into the experience, we could not eat another morsel.<br/>We had decided to walk around Copley and get dessert somewhere else, so we declined the dessert menu.<br/><br/>Minutes later we got a huge plate of Brazilian style Flan...<br/>...with happy anniversary written along the edges!<br/>That definitely was a classy gesture that put our entire dining experience over the top.<br/><br/>I'll be honest and say that this isn't a place I can come to every weekend (neither my bank balance nor my doctor would approve), but if I could, I definitely would.",5," December 6, 2019"
213,"We are definitely coming back! The buffet appetizers/salad bar were delicious. But of course the best part was the meat.

Server was right with us to explain how things worked and offer drinks etc.  First round of food was great and the guys with skewers came around very frequently. Unfortunately,  after about 15 minutes the skewer guys kept going past us and eventually they stopped coming by despite the fact three of us had green coasters showing. The server did bring a complimentary cake with icecream to the table and told her Happy Birthday, that was nice.  Overall good experience, could have been great if they kept bringing the meat. For $60 a person,  the meat should never stop.",4," November 28, 2019"

219,"It was loud and busy. The whole ‚Äúexperience‚Äù was an hour and the bill was $106.00 per person. Felt rushed and spent way too much money for the amount of  time and food. The market table had great choices, but everything is served cold. The meats were tasty, especially the lamb. The dessert was very good (cost extra) and the drinks came during the meal after several reminders. At $16 each, I expected more to the drink. Outside of the drinks (which came from the bar), the wait staff was outstanding. Tried it, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd go back. We had a party of 8, half enjoyed it the other half felt as I did. Basically, really not worth the money, especially in the city.",3," November 28, 2019"

Our waitress had our dishes removed before even asking if we were finished and essentially they were trying to push us out the door because they just wanted the table. For the price it costs to eat there, the whole experience was very disappointing to our group.",3," November 23, 2019"

Because I didn‚Äôt want to put my gum on a plate, I just sat there most of the time, not enjoying my food, but waiting on a napkin.",5," November 9, 2019"
230,"The main server was not focused and was frequently sidetracked from the service by trying to up-sell special offerings (Wagyu steak, large format wine, aged whiskeys). It was clear that his main focus was the bottom line of the check and not providing the best service possible. The only saving grace was the impeccable food and wine that Fogo is known for. Great spot, needs better servers.",3," November 8, 2019"
231,"Have dined here before, and it is always very good.  The salad bar is amazing-very fresh, great variety.  The wait staff put in a lot of effort bringing a candle for the birthday we were celebrating-and that was special.  The staff was pleasant and friendly, but service also seemed rushed and a bit disorganized at times. It seemed they were not communicating with each other about our table. Our table was seated right next to the employee cash register and glass station-which was noisy and it meant servers were over there our whole meal.

239,The worst dining experience ever. I should‚Äôve listened to the previous reviews,1," October 25, 2019"
240,Bueno. Estandarizado en alimentos y servicios,4," October 24, 2019"
241,"Was not impressed with the Boston location. The chicken was overcooked and dry while the ‚Äúcaramelized‚Äù bananas were barely cooked. They were firm and barely sweet, had the texture of plantains. Also was charged $3.75 for a tiny bottle of coke which the servers kept trying to pour into a glass with iced despite me saying I did not want ice. Eventually they took away the glass of ice....with 1/2 my coke they already poured in it. So I paid $3.75 for about 4 sips that were left in the bottle.",3," October 21, 2019"
242,"Good quality meats and selection of salads etc. <br/>Having been several times to the San Diego Fogo de Chao, I was expecting to see more of the seafood selection that was amazing in San Diego - so that was a little disappointing in the Boston restaurant. Also service was not as friendly as San Diego (hence 4 star, with San Diego being 5 star).",4," October 21, 2019"
243,"They have changed the lunchtime menu system, you now get their wonderful buffet and a choice of one meant. It is excellent value and their cold buffet has everything that I like. Smoked salmon, ham,etc.",4," October 21, 2019"
244,Our waitress was wonderful but the hosts were absolutely horrible and rude which is upsetting because we do tend to go here a lot and the table are so crammed together and only say some meats come to the table once,4," October 20, 2019"
245,Was a great time.  Lots of good food and time to enjoy our conversations,5," October 19, 2019"
246,Poor reception area. Bartenders need to smile more. They looked angry. <br/>I ordered a beer while i was waiting for my table and never got it. <br/>I also understand they were very busy making cocktails for the servers.,3," October 19, 2019"
247,"The noise level was a bit high, overall fun place for a special occasion.",5," October 19, 2019"
248,The restaurant design is one of the beautiful among The Fogo‚Äôs restaurants in other location that I have been. The service was spectacular and we have been checked numerous times to see that we have everything and we were offered to replace the plates and get fresh new one instead to enjoy the various meets and salads that we took from the salad bar. It is a good culinary experience with many options,5," October 17, 2019"
249,Tried Fogo for lunch for the first time.  Nice and quiet.  Same great service.  Food was very good as always.,4," October 14, 2019"
250,"Llevo muchos a√±os de ir a Fogo de Chao. Esta ultima vez fue muy decepcionante. El servicio muy malo, tardaron mucho en traer el vino. La Pica√±a que supuestamente es la especialidad solo nos la ofrecieron dos veces. Le pedimos Pica√±a al mesero y nos mando una Pica√±a que eran las sobras toda quemada con un sabor feo. Depspues pedi mas banano, le dije al mesero dos veces y nunca me lo mandaron. Esto deja mucho que desear de este restaurante. Especialmente por que antes era muy bueno y la calidad de la carne era mucho mejor. Es un restaurante caro y uno como consumidor espera por lo menos mejor servicio y mejor calidad de carne.",1," October 13, 2019"
251,"Great place to eat,food is A+ but a little to salty on some meats,salad bar is top notch and I love the bacon. The price is definitely higher then most,but they send out a lot of discounts through email. It would of been a 5 all the way around but I feel like they slam you with food then you never see the waiters again. I'm usually there with atleast 4 or 5 people, so I would love to enjoy all the meat they bring while I enjoy the people I'm with. Instead it's almost like a meat eating marathon no time to chat....lol And if you don't pile up the meat on your plate then you'll never see it again. I understand that its busy on the weekends but you have to also worry about people enjoying themselves not just taking the money and NEXT!!!",4," October 12, 2019"
252,"I'd advise not to go to this place within an hour before closing.  If you're going to spend all this money for sub par service and a sub par meal just because the employees are ready to go home and ready to get you out as soon as possible, then don't give customers the option to make a reservation so close to closing. It's unfair to customer experience. Most of my meat was medium well and under because there was no ""well done"" meats prepared. I felt that we didn't get our moneys worth when it came to the meat selections and felt like we just got whatever was left. It was the worst experience that we've had by far and I'm chalking it up to it being a late evening.",3," October 11, 2019"
253,"Horrible experience celebrating friends bday. Asked waitresses for wine menu, then asked if you have certain type of wine got a response I do not know then walked away. The amount of money spent no service.",1," October 11, 2019"
254,"Great value for the money. The salad bar is outstanding, and the variety of meat is well worth the cost of $39.",4," October 11, 2019"
255,For the food it was over priced.,3," October 6, 2019"
256,Great service and environment. The food is fresh and high quality. I just wish they offer parking for lunch since parking on weekend near that area is mission impossible. That would be my only complaint.,5," October 6, 2019"
257,"We love this restaurant. We took our niece/goddaughter here for her birthday. Everything was delicious and the special soft drinks they make were a nice surprise. As usual, the meats are all prepared perfectly and they are so tasty. The lamb chops and the rib-eye steaks are my favorites but everything is excellent. The service is always great. When I asked for rib-eye and it hadn‚Äôt come, they checked with me about it. They even brought my niece a piece of cake and wrote ‚Äúhappy 16th birthday‚Äù. Everyone is so nice and the food is so good. It is worth the price.",5," October 6, 2019"
258,"Perfect for brunch, wonderful service and food was terrific. Salad bar was amazing with plenty of beautiful fruits and cheeses",5," October 6, 2019"
259,"Slightly disappointing. I‚Äôm a regular at Fogo however recently they have resorted to frequent rounds of cheaper meats like top and bottom sirloin, pork, and chicken legs and will not bring any of the more expensive meats like filet mignon, lamb chops, rib eye or NY strip unless you ask for it. They created the best of Brazil cheaper version yet even if you‚Äôre willing to avoid that and pay the full $57 for a regular menu they will keep bringing the cheap meats 10x until you get full. We had to specifically ask for lamb chops, rib eye, and filet mignon every time. Multiple diners around us had voiced similar complaints. Bottom line - don‚Äôt charge full amount if you‚Äôre going to resort to cheaper meats! Will take a long break from Fogo...",3," October 5, 2019"
260,My family and I come here quite often and the food and service is always top notch!,5," October 2, 2019"
261,"I have been going to this restaurant over 4 years and every year it is worse. Quality has changed and prices have gone up considerably. Not sure it is worth the money anymore. <br/><br/>- Feijao very watery<br/>- Filet Mignon passed by once and we had to asked for.<br/>- Cheese Balls much more grease than before.<br/>- salad was ok, but not great.<br/>- farofa cold and only with bacon (nothing for vegetarians)<br/>- Feijao no longer as an option for vegetarians",3," September 30, 2019"
262,"This is one of my family favorite places in Boston. If you like to eat, and you want to try number of different cuts, I can't think of the better place then this in Boston.",5," September 30, 2019"
263,I was quite underwhelmed by Fogo De Chao. I think the experience is overrated and overpriced. On my opinion this a fancy overpriced buffet where you get a bunch of meat options constantly in your face interrupting your experience.,2," September 29, 2019"
264,It was my birthday and it was the first my party and I have been to the restaurant and we loved it!,5," September 28, 2019"
265,The food was not that good as before,4," September 27, 2019"
266,For the money it is hands down the best deal in town.,5," September 27, 2019"
267,It was not a fine dining experience at all. The host seemed like she had not even looked at the reservation request. She just gave us a random table for 2. I had requested a table near the window. The food was ok but not that great for the amount charged. The salad bar was good. The servers were nice. It just felt like going to a fancy not your average Joe's. It was a special occasion but we did not enjoy our experience as much. will not be returning here,1," September 21, 2019"
268,Birthday lunch soooooo good!,5," September 21, 2019"
269,Great food and service. We spent a wonderful time over there.,5," September 19, 2019"

271,Wedding anniversary,4," September 14, 2019"
272,"Everything was delicious!! You won‚Äôt be leaving here hungry, i can guarantee you that!! Very nice friendly wait staff! Five stars!!",5," September 14, 2019"
273,"The atmosphere is very upscale, yet comfortable. The service was impeccable - we never went thirstier hungry during our 2 hour dining experience. Every meat presented had the cooked option we wanted (rare, medium, etc) so we all enjoyed everything even though we have different palettes. This was a real treat, and  though it was expense, it was worth every dollar.",5," September 13, 2019"
274,This place was PHENOMENAL. Our waiter was a gem and the manager was excited to make our experience the best it could be. They were quick with serving us and making sure we had as much of what we wanted as we could get. Highly highly highly recommend!!!,5," September 13, 2019"
275,Very good meals and service. No complain at all.,5," September 11, 2019"
276,I had put in the reservation that it was my boyfriends birthday but they forgot i guess. which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem but the table next to us did get the birthday experience so it was kind of embarrassing since we were there to celebrate a birthday as well. the service was ok. i felt like no one really paid attention until we were toward the end of our dinner,3," September 10, 2019"
277,"We‚Äôve been here dozens of times, but the night we went for my birthday was an off night.  The food was great as usual, but the service was very off.  We were not attended to often.  My wife got served about 3 times as she had to wait as long as 30 minutes on her end of the table, along with her friend, who like their meat on the medium-well side.  Our host/waiter wasn‚Äôt attentive.  It took forever for anyone to come for our desert order or for our check.  <br/><br/>However, the GM was fantastic.  She made sure we were taken care of once she was given feedback.<br/><br/>Regardless, this will not deter us from coming back, again, and again, and again!",5," September 10, 2019"
278,Terrible <br/><br/><br/>Hahahahaha,1," September 7, 2019"
279,"The food was really terrific, but the servers were not so great, and kept trying to push us out. At three or for time a waitress would grab a plate or glass and then ask ""Are you done with this?"" Most of them said it in a friendly manner, one did it quite rudely, and I replied sternly that I was not done.<br/><br/>I do like the decor - the salad bar and meat all were delicious. The noise level is pretty high, but (just) bearable. Mostly the hustle and bustle of the place, which one can't really do much about.<br/><br/>They also stuck us in a corner table when clearly other tables were available. In fact, one of our waitresses ( the good one) had a small argument with the hostess about it. I give her props for trying.<br/><br/>I would - and will - definitely go again.",4," September 7, 2019"
280,Staff was amazing. Food was delicious. Service was exceptional.,5," September 5, 2019"
281,Great food and service.  Lovely atmosphere.  Attentive staff. Highly recommended!!,5," September 2, 2019"
282,Birthday pudding was served,5," September 1, 2019"
283,Excellent experience‚Äîeach cut of meat met our highest expectations. It was my father‚Äôs first time at Fogo and he raved about the meal.,5," August 31, 2019"
284,Staff and manager were great,5," August 30, 2019"
285,Food was fantastic as always!  Our main server made the experience slightly unpleasant though.  A lemonade took over 10 minutes to come to the table and it was about 25 minutes before any sides were delivered.  We checked with our server several times regarding the items and was told they were coming. We even asked someone bringing sides to another table and was told ours weren't ready yet.  Also disappointed that the server didn't clear the crumbs off the table before serving dessert.  The meat servers were terrific and promptly responded to food requests.,4," August 30, 2019"
286,"Great staff, great food, great experience. The food was seasoned well. If you ask for medium rare they‚Äôll give you medium rare.",5," August 29, 2019"
287,"Great service, great environment. Two thumbs up.",5," August 25, 2019"
288,"The service is one of Fogo de Chao‚Äôs best qualities, waiters are constantly moving throughout the restaurant with various meats and are ready to serve upon request.",5," August 24, 2019"
289,"Who doesn't love unlimited meat and food, with great service from the excellent hosts! Would definitely recommend.",5," August 24, 2019"
290,Complete mess with reservations.  People that had 730 reservations were still waiting at 830.  We had to wait 45 mins to be seated even though we had a reservation.  Will most likely not come again as a result of this even though we did enjoy the food once we finally sat down.,5," August 23, 2019"
291,The management of guests and tables was poor. There were long lines to be seated even though there were people with reservations. At 8pm those with 7:30 reservations were not seated yet. Super overpriced.,3," August 23, 2019"
292,"My wife and I went during Restaurant Week Boston, and really enjoyed our meal. We wanted to try something a bit different, and Fogo de Chao did not disappoint! We were a bit confused upon arrival, having never done a Brazilian Steakhouse dinner before, but our waiter graciously explained how it all works (if you don't know, ask, it'll be easier than me writing it all here) and we enjoyed a great variety of fresh items from the market table, and a staggering quantity and variety of meats that were hot off the grill! I would recommend checking out the menu prices before you go- they were running a special for Restaurant Week, but we were a bit shocked by the standard menu prices... forewarned is forearmed!",5," August 23, 2019"
293,"Yes I went for restaurant week which I‚Äôm sure all the employees don‚Äôt like, but the service was so slow and they barely came around with the steak....the whole reason to go there.  They also dripped meat juice on my shirt but luckily it came out in the wash. Not impressed.",2," August 22, 2019"
294,The lamb was excellent. The steak was a bit overdone,3," August 22, 2019"
295,Everything about it was delicious. Lots of variety and choices,5," August 22, 2019"
296,Service was outstanding  and the food was phenomenal!   I would absolutely dine there again!,5," August 21, 2019"
297,"I have been to Fogo de Chao on several occasions. Last time I went there on a date with my boyfriend. It was as expected, a great time. Food was great, the variety of meat selections was delicious, and the salad bar was clean and constantly being refilled. You let them know what type of experience you‚Äôre looking for and you will get it. Whether is a group dining experience, or a romantic dinner, they can provide it. One of my all time favorite is the (p√£o de queijo) cheese balls, and when it comes to meat (fraldilha) beef flank steak is my go to choice.",5," August 20, 2019"
298,We went to celebrate 2 birthdays &amp; it was so loud!  Salad bar was half empty.  You took the prime meet off your menu for Restaurant week.  All the meet tasted the same &amp; not up to par.  I made a reservation for 7:30 we were all present 7 of us &amp; got seated at 7:55!,2," August 20, 2019"
299,"My experience, was amazing. Food and services it is perfect.",5," August 19, 2019"
300,"My only problem was that fogo's business was too good, there were so many people that it was often hard to get meat because it was often gone by the time they got to our table. We had to ask specifically for cuts since it took so long to get anything.",4," August 18, 2019"
301,"It was the first time for most of our table and we enjoyed our meal very much. The waiters kept offering the meats to two people at our table who did not order the full experience, so it became a bit of a chore each time having to tell them no thank you, despite not having a red/green coaster in front of them. But other than that, our experience was great.",4," August 17, 2019"
302,Too expensive for what it is! They mostly serve beef! Used to be way better and diversified meat!,3," August 17, 2019"
303,Awesome as usual...best deal in city and ready for next visit!!,5," August 14, 2019"
304,"Service was okay, but left something to be desired. It was hard to find and flag down servers. <br/><br/>In terms of ambience, the Fogo in New York was far better. The Boston location felt like an Olive Garden. Children were running around everywhere and touching items on the salad bar. <br/><br/>The meat was okay but the cuts were inconsistent in terms of doneness. <br/><br/>Overall, the experience was not worth the value.",4," August 10, 2019"
305,Ho mangiato tantissimo concentratevi sulla carne e non mangiate quasi niente al buffet. Cos√¨ assaggiate tutti i tipi di carne alcuni pezzi sono particolari. I contorni li portano al tavolo quindi lasciate stare il buffet,5," August 9, 2019"

310,Good Brazilian chain restaurant. Maybe the best deal for meat eaters in tourist part of Boston.,4," August 4, 2019"
311,Always a good time with excellent service.,5," August 4, 2019"
312,It was great! The food and service were both excellent.,5," August 3, 2019"
313,This place is very busy and crowded. You can get a much nicer meal for these prices many other places in Boston.,3," August 2, 2019"
314,Loud but would go back. Better if you had a busy day and were really hungry- it's hard to say no/stop eating! Food is delicious,3," August 1, 2019"

317,They give you sooo,4," July 30, 2019"
318,"The market table (salad bar) is amazing and the meats are all delicious.  Service is fantastic.  Awesome place to celebrate a special occasion, but it's great anytime.  I started going to Fogo with a friend who was gluten sensitive and she was wowed by all the gluten free items they offered.  Since then, I'm a regular.  I love to eat at Fogo!",5," July 30, 2019"
319,Always good.,4," July 29, 2019"
320,"Always great! We dine here often. Expensive, but well worth it!",5," July 28, 2019"
321,Anniversary,5," July 25, 2019"
322,Great value especially with kids!,4," July 21, 2019"
323,"I was a little wary because of the price (I don't usually spend a lot of money at nice restaurants!), but we went with the Full Churrasco Experience for $57.95 and let me say... it was MORE than worth it! The Feijoada Bar and Market Table alone were great, but the cuts of meat brought by the servers were delicious. The amount of delicious food that we ate was worth probably triple the price. It still isn't in my budget to make this a regular restaurant, but it'll be my new go-to for a nice meal!",4," July 20, 2019"
324,Excellent food with great ambiance and service! Definitely worth the money! A must visit!,5," July 20, 2019"
325,Absolutely awful. We had to flag down someone after about 20 minutes to order cocktails. 30 minutes later cocktails finally arrived. Waited another 25 minutes and still no food despite asking no less than 4 servers to have the meat servers come to our table.  We finally left to heat up leftovers at home. Worst restaurant experience ever. Will never go back!  Ruined my husband‚Äôs birthday!,1," July 20, 2019"
326,"If there is a discount going on, please let the server / host know before you start dining. Otherwise the discount is invalid if you mention it after dining. They do this because the discount does not include premium cuts of meat. We wish we had known this prior to dining, but unfortunately the advertisements we saw did not include this vital piece of information. <br/><br/>Service: A span of 20 minutes would go by without a server to come offer us more cuts of meat. We also were unable to get seated unless we had the majority of the party present. We had 4 out of 7 people present initially, so I‚Äôm not sure why they still were unable to seat us.",3," July 20, 2019"
327,A very interesting &amp; worthwhile dining experience! Best of its' type around. Not a great value for money -- though food is delicious and very well-prepared. Suggest that staff could provide a lot of value to the overall experience through much more energetic &amp; theatrical service.,3," July 20, 2019"
328,"Service at Fogo is always amazing attentive, food quality exceptional and festively served and always very tasty, the choices are seemingly endless and satisfying.  Wine &amp; drinks that we had were all on the mark and a good value.  We've found that being seated by 6 PM helped a lot since once it gets into peak dinner time the noise gets high and conversations for a group can be a challenge.  Would of course use any excuse to go to Fogo.",5," July 19, 2019"
329,Great service and fantastic food!,5," July 18, 2019"
330,"In the corner table, close to the wall service was inadeguate mostly for logistic but overall where they seat you makes the difference",1," July 17, 2019"
331,"After looking at our options, we opted to eat at 2pm on Sunday for ""dinner"" to take advantage of the restaurant month offer and not be too stuffed to sleep at night. Unfortunately, we may have been at one of the last tables to be seated for the section we were in. Meats did not make many rounds and there were instances where we were waiting for them to come around. Not that we needed to be checked on frequently, but our waitress never came around to see how we were doing and we had to get her attention to order a soda and ask for the check. Maybe we just came at an odd time, but maybe it's because we were getting the cheaper offer.",3," July 14, 2019"
332,"We love Fogo de Chao generally, but the Boston experience was very much below expectations. The service was quite bad and the quality of the food below Fogo‚Äôs standard. <br/>We have been as a family many many times in Baltimore, Washington DC, Miami and Las Vegas and always loved it. <br/>The Boston location needs improvements.",3," July 14, 2019"
333,"We knew about the restaurant as we ate at the D.C. site. It was everything we expected.  Lots of meat that was delicious and well prepared.  <br/>The service is great as they work as a team.  We never had to wait for a server, and they were all quite gracious.",4," July 13, 2019"
334,Love coming here!!! The food is always fresh And the staff is amazing.,5," July 12, 2019"

339,"The food never disappoints. It really is worth it to just get the ""salad bar,"" but how can one say no to the amazingly flavorful meats? Personally, I had the sea bass this time. Not as impressive as the meat options would have been.  The tres leches dessert was a huge hit. Everyone left dinner quite happy, including the teen.",5," June 30, 2019"
340,"Awesome service, excellent meat",5," June 30, 2019"

343,"Where to start. The food was a good choice but we were overcharged and when we brought it up to the manager she said she had made the charges void and then had us pay another price, but when we got our credit card bill she had not made our first payment void but had ended up charging double. This has been a pain to get our credit card company to figure out. What a pain.",3," June 24, 2019"
344,Excellent food and service. The staff was very attentive.  In fact the manager visited our table to check in and confirm we were happy diners.,5," June 23, 2019"

346,Ok but limited meats. Not the variety expected,4," June 23, 2019"
347,"Food and service were good.  My problem came with the settling off the bill.  I had the email that designated me for a $30.00 discount.  The waiter cam back an said that it was expired.  When I checked the email again, it reads the $30.00 promotion was extended through June 30th, 2019.  It would be nice to get that rebated back to me in some way shaper or form.  Obviously, the wait staff was made aware of the extension.  I have my dinner receipt form Sunday afternoon and I still have the promo email in my inbox showing the extension.  Hopefully, Fago de Chao could find a way in rebating me the $30.00 or the form of a future gift card would be nice.  It was the primary reasons for dinning there this past Sunday and is quite discouraging to get this discount applied to my dining check!! Otherwise, it will be my last time dining there!!<br/><br/>Bernard M. Brown",2," June 23, 2019"

350,Do not book your table after 8pm. Your meet servers will stop coming to your table after just a half an hour since your seating. Not worth ordering your $59 Brazilian meet experience because you will not be served after 9pm. Waiter disappeared with our wine order. Never came back. Other waiters were busy chatting with each other rather then seeing customers. We went to the same place in Philadelphia a few months ago. Incomparable!!!! Food is great but service is very poor in Boston.,1," June 16, 2019"

362,Excellent place for special occasion. Go hungry! The salad bar is outstanding and that alone can be your (excellent and filling) meal.

364,"I've been to a couple Fogo de Ch√£o locations and Boston is unfortunately the most disappointing. Today's lunch hit a low even accounting for that. No meat service for over half an hour, despite asking the gaucho, meat was way undercooked, never cleared plates... I've been here 4-5 times, just because I like the concept, but I think this was definitely the last time. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other meat places in the area and go to a Fogo location in another city.",1," June 11, 2019"

368,"All of the meats were too heavily salted. The salad bar was plentiful and beautiful but many items had no flavor; ie the broccoli, prosciutto and the tomatoes and mozzarella.  I enjoyed the side dishes served at the table. The fried bananas were delicious.  The service was very good. We just were not Wowed by the food.",3," June 8, 2019"
369,"We have been to restaurants from this chain in 5 US locations, and each one has been very, very good. At our table, three had the full meal, and one (me) just had the Market Table. Overall, this continues to be the best restaurant of this style at which we have ever eaten. While I sometimes do enjoy the meat, too, the Market Table is what a salad bar wants to grow up to be. The wait staff in general were delightful, as were the front desk staff.<br/><br/>Thank you all for your courtesy, your kindness to our friend who needed a walker, and your great good humor. Of course we‚Äôll be back. :-)  Or back to the ones in San Antonio, Chicago, Kansas City, or Baltimore, too!",5," June 8, 2019"

383,"My husband is originally from Rio de Janiero.  We have been to many a Brazil restaurant here in the states but this by far was the worst.  Service was non unless you complained to a manager.  The meat had no garlic no salt and no flavor.  When we asked 4x in a hour for some fried Yucca, we got 4 pieces that were still frozen in the middle.  The mashed potatoes were like soup and the lettuce in the salad were wilted.  We asked for lime for our sodas and never got them.  Would not recommend.",2," May 24, 2019"

The service was great, I was just a little disappointed that they never sang to my fiance (we were there for his birthday and I made mention several times and even the server realized the mistake) It was not the worst thing that could of happened, and he was OK with is.... but I wanted to make it special for him. Other than that it was a amazing experience! We will be back",4," May 11, 2019"
396,"Total money rip off. Hyped for no reason. Menu shows 19 or so different kind of meat however only about 5 to 6 options are served. We waited for almost 2 hours but still they kept repeating the meat options. Its not worth the $$$ they charge for the experience. Also, even the 5 to 6 meat options which we did try did not have flavors at all.",2," May 11, 2019"

Thank you for the sympathy of the girl at the reception, I also thank the girl who lent me her phone porter, and to finish I am very grateful for the cape verdien girl who served me the table, was very friendly and professional. Finally there was another Brazilian girl, who talked a little bit but then disappeared, I think she must have finished her shift. In general note 10. the food was amazing.",5," May 11, 2019"

401,"Probably one of the most unique and special dining experiences in Boston!<br/><br/>You're first greeted by the massive and extensive salad bar. While it is incredible, don't be distracted by this! The real treat is the meat. My first time here, I ate a full plate of salad and I could barely get through as much steak as I wanted. Nibble away at the salad bar items, but don't go too crazy. That being said, some of the best salad bar items are: smoked salmon with capers, candied bacon, kale salad, fruits, a huge leg of parma ham, cheeses, and more!<br/><br/>Now for the main course: MEAT. I stay away from the chicken, because I'm there to eat red meat, not that white bird meat meant for lowly peasants. My top choices are the filet mignon, the bone-in ribeye steak, the top and bottom sirloin (chewier, but so flavorful), and of course, the Brazilian favorite: Pichanha, in all it's crispy fat glory. The rest of the items are just okay, such as the lamb, the bacon wrapped filet (not very tender), and the sausages. So I suggest trying a small taste of everything, and picking your own favorites!<br/><br/>The price is very high, for an all-you-can-eat steak experience. It comes out to roughly $80 per person. But if you love meat and you can eat a lot, it's worth the price!<br/><br/>(ALSO, I asked for an extra order of their free bread, this amazing cheese bread called P√£o de Queijo. It's made from glutinous flour and cheese and baked. Amazingly fluffy and cheesy.)",5," May 5, 2019"
402,Very good service. Excellent staff. We had a reservation but we were able to be seated much earlier than our scheduled time.,5," May 4, 2019"

405,"Very good meat. Buffet very extensive with good salads and vegetables. Everything looked really fresh. We are not very big eaters, so it‚Äôs relatively expensive for us.",5," May 2, 2019"
406,"Very intense, transactional experience courtesy of the very intense, transactional staff. They seem to have been trained to actively avoid respecting their customers' personal space. <br/><br/>It is one thing to check in on your table as a server, but to dictate the pace in which one eats steak is an experience for which one should be paid for - not the other way around.",2," April 30, 2019"
407,"Fogo de Chao never disappoints. It was another delightful experience for my BF, who loves meats and for me, who loves everything else. Keep the salad bar fresh and the selection abundant and everybody will be happy. Our server was outstanding and we'll be back for sure.",4," April 27, 2019"
408,"Pricing was a bit confusing, Bill came with charges on it for meats for two of the vegans in our party but was cleared up quickly. They vegans loved the marketplace bar just didn‚Äôt want to eat or pay for meats",4," April 27, 2019"

419,"This is our second time to Fogo and we were a bit disappointed. We absolutely loved it before but we found the meats were not as good this time around. The steak options were either tough or fatty, the chicken was very dry. We enjoyed the pork and lamb options.",4," April 20, 2019"
420,Very nice spread of fresh vegetables and fruits to start off with.  It's hard to not want to fill up with the variety before the meats arrive.  The meats were perfectly seasoned and cooked.  You will not be disappointed!,5," April 20, 2019"

428,"The real dichotomy IMHO is that the salad and side dish bar is probably better than the main courses! However, you feel guilty not loading up on the meats.  The premise is that you ""buffet"" style get your sides and a salad then as long as you want it they bring you spits of lamb, chicken, pork and meat.  there are only a few meal choices and they want you to sign up for the ""whole experience"", which is fine but at $56 that is priced for the large eater and for many of us we don't eat that way anymore.<br/>The service was pretty good, although you start with the buffet by serving yourself, there are so many options there that this is probably the best way to do it.  The offer a number of specialty drinks but they are pricey and and a bit overdone.  Overall it's a decent experience but for most of us at the table it's too pricey and meat based for frequent dining.",3," April 13, 2019"
429,The food was good but the flow of food is challenging even if you flip your coaster.  It's difficult to ensure you get the cuts of meat you prefer without being distracted from conversation etc.  I would prefer a high end buffet where you can choose the timing and choices to better suite your needs.  It feels like a chain restaurant and not as authentic as I hoped.,3," April 13, 2019"
430,Everything was perfect! From the meal to the drinks to the charm of our waiters and waitresses. We loved it so much we came back for lunch the next day!,5," April 12, 2019"

436,"I love Fogo de Chao and most of the Brazilian steakhouses.  Fogo is always great.  Its not cheap at $57.50 per person for the full churrascaria, but you get to literally eat as much as you want, and the food is great.  My only complaints are that many of the meats are coming out too rare.....even the first slice from the outside is literally uncooked some of the time.  Not just rare, but actually uncooked.  I don't eat it like this, so I just put those raw slices aside and keep asking for more until I get something similar to medium. I'm sure most other people do not eat it like this either, so many slices are going to waste.  I wish they would just keep it on the fire a bit longer.  And my other complaint is that the knives are not sharp at all!  This is a steakhouse, so they should have good, sharp steak knives, but instead everyone at my table, and most of the tables around us had what seemed like dull butter knives!",4," April 6, 2019"
437,I‚Äôve been going there frequently and have always went very satisfied however this time the meats were taking forever to come to our table. They were mostly serving chicken and pork. We had to ask the waiter over 5x to bring us some steaks.<br/>Steaks were very tough and over rare. <br/>I like this place but I hope they will relook at the current situation and fix it because they will lose a lot of customers,3," April 6, 2019"

None were of the quality I‚Äôd expect if I‚Äôd ordered that specific item as an entree. The various types of chicken were very dry. I appreciated the complementary dessert to note my son‚Äôs birthday.",2," March 31, 2019"
443,"Food is amazing, all the best meat cuts. Highlights as always: Picanha, Pork Ribs, Fraldinha. <br/>Salad bar is very good. Just the Feijoada that could be better. <br/>Service was excellent!!! All waiters/waitresses were very attentive, polite, friendly.",5," March 31, 2019"
444,"It's hard to compare a churrascaria to another restaurant because the concept and experience is so unique, but having dined at many American churrascarias I can say that this Fogo is superior to the Fogo in San Jose, CA and on par with the Fogos in DC and Orlando.  Good ""salad"" bar with some nice rotating/special items.  Lots of roaming gauchos, although not as much variety of cuts as you'd expect on a Saturday night.  We had to make a few requests for particular cuts‚Äîincluding med rare picanha, which should be the most popular‚Äîbut overall we were able to get what we wanted to eat in a reasonable amount of time.  A random point, but: the steak knives need to be upgraded or sharpened; they seemed lower quality than I've had before at Foto or Texas de Brazil, or mom and pop churrascarias, or at least they had dulled substantially.   Either way, you will never regret a meat parade like you'll find at Fogo, so it's always a good experience.",4," March 30, 2019"
445,"Excellent food. Salad bar is exceptional and the variety of meats the gaucho chefs bring over are always delicious. I have been here many times but brought a couple friends for the first time and their expectations were easily surpassed. One of my favorite meats is the Parmesan pork, and dessert has to be the tres leches cake.",5," March 30, 2019"
446,"(THIS REVIEW IS FOR BOSTON FOGO DE CHAO, NOT SURE WHY IT SAYS LA)I asked for a beer for me and one for my wife at the beginning and server never came back asking if I wanted more. Good variety of salads but hot food buffed only had white rice and feijoada(beans). Skewer guys were not diligent coming back to the table and a few times I had to keep calling them and waiving believe it or not! First server disappeared and a lady came over to help us , no smile , no hi how are you nothing .. my wife waited 15 minutes for a piece of meat towards the end and when I lost my patience to wait I called out loud for a passing by server who went to get the guy.... this time our server showed up asking ‚Äúwhat kind of meat did you want ?‚Äù Again no smiles , almost as if she was doing us a favor... for this price $52.95 a person I was expecting a lot more ... when I go to the cape I go to Brazilian Grill where food is 10 times better , service is superior! Also charged my 2 10 and 11 years old kids full price and when I asked for it to be reviewed no apologies were offered .. again the lady thought she was doing me a favor ... very unpleasant afternoon at this place!

452,I normally don‚Äôt do any written reviews but I was appalled at the service provided. I went with a group of friends to the Brazilian buffet for an event. My boyfriend and I knew that the menu was going to accommodate our diets so we skipped out on the high dollar steak buffet. The rest of our friends ordered this options which was fine with us. I guess this is a rare occurrence because all the waiters started to whisper and watch our able to make sure we didn‚Äôt touch any of there meat. It was very noticeable and everyone just felt very uncomfortable.,1," March 23, 2019"

You can ask anyone to help, and they are so nice! The manager, Ana, is fabulous! The food was delicious - the filet was absolutely amazing! We always have a great experience at Fogo.",5," March 17, 2019"

Service was awful from the start. Had no idea who the server was- he or she never made it clear, didn‚Äôt introduce themselves and never checked on the meal. Not once. Nor did a manager for that matter- in fact there seemed to be no manager presence in the room. It made service look chaotic and rushed. I left a small tip on a large check because in this industry of which I am a part, good service reaps good tip. I‚Äôd come back for the food but might think twice because the service is really really lacking.",4," March 12, 2019"

477,Good food the service. Love the lamb there. Sometimes there're guests who think they own the place but it's not the restaurants' fault.,5," March 8, 2019"
478,"It was my birthday dinner and I was just unsatisfied with the lack of side options but the parm pork , the chicken and steak wrapped in bacon was better without the bacon tbh , the lamb and the pepper beef i think it was , was yummy. The drinks were perfect as well as the service. However, I most likely won‚Äôt be back and that‚Äôs okay but thank you for such phenomenal service from jessica and lisa!",3," March 8, 2019"

480,"Visited for Dine Out Boston last week on Friday night. Service, as usual, was very attentive and catered to our every need. They truly want you to have an amazing experience. Food was delicious, and salad bar was fresh.",5," March 8, 2019"
481,"They came out like initially with the food then we never saw them again -we had to ask the servers to send the people back with the steak and it took 15- 20 minutes. A 3rd time we had to requested them to come back which took another 15 minutes, just awful. Once we got coffee and dessert left at the table they dropped the check off at the same time and never asked if We would like another refill of coffee.  It was all about how quick they could get us out of there and turn the table over. From the time we sat down till the time we walked out the door we were in and out of there in an hour and 15 minutes.",2," March 8, 2019"
482,The chicken was dry and the waiter we had hardly came over to check on us. The steak selection did not.come by the table as often we would like. But the steak we did receive was good. Probably wouldn't go back for 53$ per person,4," March 7, 2019"
483,"Food and service is excellent! Definitely recommend reservations.  Not the place for vegetarians or vegans. Come hungry! Our favorite meat of the evening was the parmesan pork and the bacon wrapped chicken, but each meat was excellent.  Great for a group too!",5," March 7, 2019"
484,Experience was amazing. Food was great and the service was fantastic! Came for dine out Boston and you really do get your moneys worth for 38$ per person!,5," March 7, 2019"
485,Delicious food. Such a good value for restaurant week! The picanha was our favorite.,5," March 6, 2019"
486,All of the red meat that came out was rare and it was extremely disappointing. Took probably an hour before our party started to receive meat that was cooked at least medium well.,3," March 5, 2019"
487,We came for restaurant week and will go back.<br/>The food was tasty and well prepared. Service was exemplary!,5," March 3, 2019"
488,"I am quite disappointed at the service level provided by Fogo de Chao this time. I came here two years ago during the same Restaurant Week, their service level was phenomenal, therefore I came back again this year. However, the server did not give us any greetings and even though my friend told him it was his first visit, no help was offered. We were sitting there for 10 minutes until another server stopped by to ask us if we needed anything. Restaurant Week should be a good platform for restaurants to show their best to the public, not to discount their services provided.",3," March 3, 2019"
489,"Went during dine out boston and it definitely worth it! Usually it is 56 dollars per person with full menu choice. Dine out boston menu is limited but trust me, it was enough, especially for a 5 foot 2 girl like me. The server kept coming and serving meat with many  different choices of cut, and the buffet table was wonderful with various veggies, cheese, and fruits. I had my cactus fruit (dont know the exact name) for the first time. It was fun. But speaking of the taste of the meat. To be honest, I can‚Äôt remember. The server served the food nonstop and I was busy cutting the meat and putting the meat into my mouth non stop. But i was sooooo full at the end. No wonder! Cuz i didnt have time kept my mouth shut! <br/>The dessert was okay quality. Traditional American dessert. <br/>But our waitress forgot to bring one of my friends‚Äôs dessert. We asked twice then she brought over. And she even gave us a wrong check. Thank my friend who checked the bill.<br/>Overall, it was a nice experience. The price (for dine out boston) was acceptable, and the food was nice (in terms of quality and choices)",4," March 3, 2019"
490,"I keep returning because the food, service, and ambiance are so outstanding.  From the prompt seating to the almost immediate service to take our drinks order, to the clear explanation of the Dine-Out Boston menu, we had constant but non-intrusive attention.  <br/>The salad bar (Market Table) has to be seen and sampled to be believed.  Prosciutto, smoked salmon, salami's, cheeses, asparagus, palmitos (hearts of palm), artichokes, plus a wide assortment of vegetables and fruit.    <br/>The Fraldinha (Flank Steak) was exquisite - tender and medium rare as requested.  The Picanha and Alcatra (top sirloin cuts) were also delicious, tender and juicy.<br/>I cannot fail to mention the scrumptious cheese bread - warm, light and cheesy.    <br/>I have been recommending Fogo to my friends and family for more than 15 years",5," March 3, 2019"
491,Fogo de Chao is a casual all you can eat Brazilian Steakhouse. I went there for dinner on a Sunday and it was quite busy. The meat was not bad but it wasn't 'wow' either. If you really want to see what all you can eat steakhouse looks like I recommend Fogo de Chao for a casual lunch instead.,4," March 2, 2019"
492,It was a great experience for my father‚Äôs birthday. Nothing too fancy but just the right amount. The waiter was awesome and you get soo much value out of your money there. There is almost too much food. It was a wonderful time!,5," March 2, 2019"
493,"Never disappoints.  Service is as good as anywhere.  Take a sip of water, and it‚Äôs immediately refilled.  Meats come out more than often enough.  Food always good.  The beef was very good, not great, as it‚Äôs been in the past.  All of the chickens were outstanding.  Fogo de Chao is always a great spot to spend a nice meal, with good food.",5," March 2, 2019"
494,Amazing food &amp; our waitress was the best! Would definitely come back again! The garlic steak was our favorite,5," March 1, 2019"

505,"From a non meat eater but mom of 2 boys who are, it was a wonderful meal. I had the salmon and that was equally as delish as the boys said the meat experience was!",5," February 22, 2019"
506,"First time there, and had a large group. Service was tremendous and the overall concept is very cool. the 'salad bar' (much more than a salad bar) was unexpected and really enjoyable and the meats were all great, once you got the hang of the system in terms of how to signal you were interested in more.... once issue was some people missed out on certain things they wanted to try because you can't predict what will be coming around at any moment. While its a 'beef' place the chicken wrapped in bacon was phenomenal and actually a favorite for many people. A bit expensive and its chaotic in a good way, but if you want a quiet, sit-down traditional dinner I'd go elsewhere. But lots of fun and a different experience if you're looking for that.",4," February 22, 2019"
507,"I had reserved a table for 5 for my father‚Äôs 80th birthday., which I mentioned in my reservation. We are Asian. When they brought us to our table, we passed several tables of 6 in the main room and they put us in the corner next to the bussing stand. The second room we were in was completely empty. When I asked why we were being shoved into the corner, they said there were only tables for four which was obviously not true because there was a round table for 6 by the window. About 15 min later, the hostess brought in a party of 5 people past us to the window table. They were Caucasian. It was offensive and upsetting. We spent $400 on a meal watching the wait staff milling around the busssing station.",1," February 22, 2019"

511,Great place,5," February 17, 2019"
512,"ABSOLUTELY SKIP THIS PLACE... The issue is not cost even though it is over priced for what your actually receiving but the dismal food. The food is tasteless, bland and genuinely unappealing much like their service from the moment you step out of your car. A Tysons TV dinner from a microwave would be considerable step up from this. They might as well add the Burger King value menu so that guests will have a better choice of food. The service was awful (Wasn't sure who my even server was) it could've been the gentlemen that filled our water 3 times prior to even being greeted or  the woman named  leticia that took our first drink order, lets just say that was the only time we interacted with this one server. It took close to 40 minutes to receive our drink order and we never received our second round of beverages that we order and payed for. We chose this location to celebrate valentines dinner and I will never go back. The experience at Fogo de Chao was a complete waste, loss of a night time and money.  The menu and process of the restaurant was never fully explained to my table or the others around us. Then when asked for a check it took another 30 minute wait amongst requesting to speak to a manager I had no type of management to speak to. Then to pay for Valet was a mess lost my keys for over an hour. I will never return to this so called Brazilian steak house.",1," February 16, 2019"

525,We sat and wanted to order drinks and catch up. We had a reservation for 6 and they stuck us in a corner next to kitchen. So we were bombarded by meat. It was fresh and hot though! Table should not be for six in that location. Waiter was fine it was the other helper people who rushed us. Like go to salad bar now! Give us a minute please. But they kept at it despite red cards still came over. We went to salad bar and it was ok. The candied bacon is amazing but here it‚Äôs tiny bacon pieces. Other locations it‚Äôs full pieces. <br/>I‚Äôm good to not return to this location. Much more elegant in San Diego and in New Orleans. This location wasn‚Äôt as clean and open. Very crowded tables. We spent 1.5 hrs and arrived after and left before other tables because we felt so rushed. Also it‚Äôs confusing where to park. They wouldn‚Äôt validate our parking so it was $40 in garage so we went into mall to buy something to get validated.,4," February 2, 2019"
526,"Fogo de Ch√£o is always amazing. The food is delicious with tons of options, even if you don‚Äôt want/like meat. But this time the service was incredible. We had our 7 month old baby girl with us for the first time and asked for ‚Äúany type of meat they could make without any salt‚Äù. They brought to our table, exclusively for her: chicken hearts (a Brazilian tradition), picanha and filet mignon. If we hadn‚Äôt told them it was enough, they would‚Äôve kept bringing more and more. Oh, and all that while the restaurant was packed. If that isn‚Äôt outstanding service, I don‚Äôt know what is.",5," February 2, 2019"

533,"Loved the Market Table (salad bar).  You can easily make a whole meal just from that.  Pricing for full experience is far too high for lunch-seems more like a dinner pricing, imo.  And they have no child/senior pricing (I asked) which makes it tough at lunch.  We went with my 81 y.o. mil and $37.95 is ridiculous for most people, let alone an older person. She only eats a small amount unless it‚Äôs salad so doing anything besides MarketTable is a waste.  Same goes for children.  The chicken was dry, per usual, but the meats were all very tasty.",4," January 23, 2019"

I wasn‚Äôt happy about it, asked for another seating position, but it wasn‚Äôt available even without checking.

Our server was wonderful and even tracked down 2nd and 3rd helpings of everyone's favorite meats before all cards were finally flipped to red. They also enjoyed the serve yourself salad bar. Discounted prices for children made it worth our while.,4," January 6, 2019"
547,Waitress was stone faced and never came back. Another waitress brought us the check. Asked to see a fish menu since I don't eat meat and never got it so I paid $50 for the salad bar. Waste of money for those not eating meat and absolutely awful service.,1," January 5, 2019"

551,"I've eaten at a few Brazilian BBQ places before but Fogo De Chao by far was the best.  The cuts of meats were certainly above what I've had before as was the seasoning.  The servers were very attentive finding the cuts and temperatures of meats that we requested.  The offerings from the Market Table were also a step above the standard salad bar with a kale salad and apple salad that stood out for me.  Plus the cheesy bread!  OMG!  There are no words to describe how wonderful that was!  Though the food was plentiful I found it easy to keep to my basic meal plan (protein and veg) so most with dietary concerns shouldn't have a problem here (except if you are Vegan  - this is NOT the place for you).  This was also my boyfriend's first time at Brazilian BBQ and boy did it blow his mind!  He's declared he wants  to come back for any and all ""man occasions"".",5," December 31, 2018"

554,"Food was great, but service was rude. Server literally tried to rush us out of there, handing us dessert menus before anyone was clearly done with their meal. <br/><br/>It ruined an otherwise good meal as the service really put a sour note on a New Years Eve dinner event for our party of 6.",1," December 31, 2018"

556,"An excellent dining experience with sumptuous meats and a vibrant salad bar. Very good for you paleo and primal types, or people with a big appetite. Nice thing is that you regulate what you want and portion sizes. Waiters with personality bring a variety of beautifully prepared meats to the table and carve to order., Brazilian style - a must if you have yet to try that style, and a place you will return to if you have! Food is plentiful with concessions for kids dining with adults. We have dined as a family and with friends on a number of occasions, and never been disappointed.

565,"Christmas Eve 2018 visit.  <br/>They began bringing the meat while we still had our dirty salad plates in front of us‚Äîso they served the meat on our dirty salad plates and our bread plates!!!  It took a few rounds before they brought us clean dinner plates (we all piled our dirty salad plates in the middle of the table).  We had already been eating for about 10 minutes when a waiter asked if we wanted the side dishes.  Really?  Why would we not want the side dishes??  I thought this would include the mini popovers.  We had to request that they serve us the mini popovers, which were finally brought out more than mid-way through our meal.  <br/><br/>The meat was good, but the slices were too thick in my opinion.  <br/><br/>One of our guests asked for coffee after all the dishes were cleared, and it took more than 10 minutes‚Äîand the guest had to ask again if he could have his coffee.<br/><br/>This location can‚Äôt hold a candle to the Houston, Texas location.  My family has gone to that location every year on Christmas Eve for probably 10 years.  What a huge disappointment this was.  Now I know why the place wasn‚Äôt crowded.  In Houston you can barely walk through the door on Christmas Eve.",2," December 24, 2018"

576,"Top quality meats, fabulous market b ar, friendly service.  Definitely recommend thus restaurant",5," December 19, 2018"
577,"A friend recommended this and another Brazilian Steak House in Somerville, recommending  it for its ambience. My wife and I felt that the service was very good and speedy, but that the salad bar, food and ambience only about average. Moreover, the drinks were too pricy for the selections available. Finally, we both had an upset stomach, my wife also experiencing stomach pain.<br/><br/>While we would not go as far as discouraging people to try the restaurant, we would not be revisiting again.",3," December 18, 2018"
578,It was my one year anniversary with my boyfriend and he loves all meats so Fogo de Ch√£o was the natural choice. The waiter asked us what we were celebrating and without asking he wrote happy anniversary in chocolate on our creme br√ªl√©e. What a great experience highly recommend!,5," December 17, 2018"
579,"Service was disappointing.  Waiter and waitress did not communicate well and they screwed up our drink order several times and screwed up our bill several times as well.  Food was ample and adequate, but for the price, the ""garden"" bar was much better than the many meats (some of which were over done)",3," December 17, 2018"
580,Went for Business lunch.  Everyone loved the food.  Service was fantastic!  Great experience!,5," December 17, 2018"
581,A Christmas lunch which we‚Äôve done for 4 years. We all love Fogo de Chao and this is the only restaurant we consider. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the meats compared to previous years but it was still very good. The salad bar is outstanding and the drinks as well. I‚Äôm sure we will be returning next year.,4," December 17, 2018"
582,"This was my first time at Fogo de Chao,  I was celebrating my birthday. The meats were delicious and flavorful. If you haven't been here before it is a must!  They gave me a surprise Flan for my birthday. I thought I was full from all the meats, but I made room for the flan üòÄ",5," December 16, 2018"
583,Waitress had an attitude.,1," December 16, 2018"
584,Wonderful dinner. A busy evening at Fogo but the ambiance was great. Food was delicious and perfectly cooked as always. Will absolutely be returning in future,5," December 15, 2018"
585,"Still very good, although the bowls of cheese bread have gotten smaller, they are refilled. Meat could be more tender (they are cooking it faster and at higher temperatures rather than how they used to). Caipirinhas still excellent. So some small slippage over the years, and make sure you are seated somewhere in sight of the salad bar. If you are in the back alcove, ask for your table to be moved as the waiters almost never make their way back there (it will take hours to get the meat you want). but you‚Äôll be well served and fairly well fed in the main dining room.",4," December 15, 2018"

591,"Excellent meal excellent service--however given it us the holiday season I gave a 30 percent tip and would have appreciated a simple ""thank you """,4," December 9, 2018"

593,Food was delicious. Only problem was having to wait 45 minutes to get the check after eating then another 10 minutes to run my card. Huge disappointment with the ending of dinner.,3," December 8, 2018"

597,The restaurant is a popular choice for Holiday parties.,3," December 4, 2018"
598,"We went in with high hopes of celebrating our 10th anniversary with an unforgettable experience... unfortunately it was pretty forgettable.  The food was good but not as good as you should be able to expect for the price.  Our main complaints were:<br/>We saw 'filet mignon' on the menu but after 45 minutes of lower quality cuts passing by, we spoke to a manager and only then was it offered up...<br/>We mentioned 'a quiet table for our anniversary' in the special requests but that did not happen and nothing was offered for us to celebrate with.",3," December 1, 2018"
599,Abaolutly amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to go back food service everything about this place was amazing. No stress for parking which was the biggest win. Pull upfront pay 20$ for valet and go enjoy your meal. 15 min before your done. Text a number and my truck was outside warmed up waiting for me.,5," December 1, 2018"
600,"This is a very interesting restaurant. Unless you are REALLY hungry, you will probably not get the value out of what you are paying for. They charge a flat rate and your meat is served to you as you ask for it. Yes very tasty cuts, I would have liked to see some other cuts offered, but we were there late afternoon/early evening. It would probably be different if one was to visit during prime time dinner hours. Overall it was a good take. Not the type of place you go in for a quick bite. Spend some time, try the different options with a couple bottles of wine to compliment the meat.",4," December 1, 2018"
601,First time here celebrating my friend‚Äôs birthday. Miguel was phenomenal and catered to our every need. My friend had the time of his life. Thank you for an amazing experience we will be back soon!,5," November 26, 2018"
602,Very spotty with serving different cuts of meat. Not impressed with the food this time around,3," November 24, 2018"

606,I celebrated Thanksgiving with my family. It was a lot good food and tasty.,5," November 22, 2018"
607,We love this place but it was super packed with the holiday and the men with the meats seemed to be a little slower to get around this time.,3," November 22, 2018"
608,"I used to love this place, but my last 2 visits   I had an horrible waitress, she was very rude to my mother who can't speak English  (only Portuguese) acting like she didn't want to be there, for the price I would expect so much more.",3," November 22, 2018"
609,Outstanding array of meats cooked to perfection with a beautiful and plentious salad bar.,5," November 21, 2018"

612,One of our favorites!  Love the salad bar option.  Great drinks and wine list.   Great and friendly servers.  a fun place to go and great if you're in a rush because everything comes right out.,5," November 17, 2018"
613,"How much can you eat? This largely determines this restaurant's value. Certainly, we can not eat much in the  one after another situation. We expected little more juicy meats, which depended on what part you eat.  The total payment including two drinks, tax, and tip was almost $180 for two persons. Not worth the price, unfortunately.",3," November 17, 2018"
614,"Probably our favorite restaurant in Boston.  The salad bar is incredible and meats cooked to perfection.  The waitstaff are friendly, knowledgeable, and eerily tuned in to anticipating when to drop by.  The place ain't cheap, however.",5," November 17, 2018"
615,"First visit to Brazilian Steakhouse.  Server not available to engage and answer questions. Better fit group, but individual first visit overwhelming and decreased comfort!",3," November 17, 2018"
616,"It‚Äôs pretty much what you‚Äôd expect from a higher end Brazilian bbq steakhouse.  Overpriced unless you have a hefty appetite but understandable given the location and quality.  I‚Äôve had more extensive variety of meats at a different restaurant with a comparable menu at a price more competitive than the brunch menu but it was at the cape.  The service was great aside from the Ma√Ætre d who clearly wasn‚Äôt friendly to anyone at all and appeared to dampen the atmosphere, but the friendly and vigilant roaming waitstaff made up for what was lacking.  We were there for a special occasion, but they appeared to have not read any of the notes I put in my reservation.  However, when I asked a server whether they do anything special, they graciously offered a comped dessert.  Plus the server was very smart, making sure to roam while hiding the dessert from view to surprise the birthday girl as she returned to her seat.",4," November 17, 2018"
617,"Man I would say this establishment has its business model down packed!  The quality of food is great but there is just no way to eat everything ; you get your money's worth I suppose but its possible to get full fast with how fast the food comes out and all the options; so come hungry and pace yourself.  Their sides are really good too ; the candied bacon next to their salad spread was like my favorit thing.  I like that you can request the steak medium well rather than medium if you want; but if you like steak; stay focused because all the other options will distract you and you will be too full to enjoy as much as you set your heart out for.  It was great for my family members milestone birthday and they have a setup for larger groups (long tables)....its in the city but with $20 valet, parking is a breeze too.",4," November 16, 2018"
618,The food was great and the service was even better!!!  I haven't eaten here in years but will certainly come back soon.,5," November 13, 2018"
619,it was great!!,5," November 11, 2018"
620,"For the first time, service was no good.  Waitress dissapeared for a long time and we couldn‚Äôt get new drinks with our food.  We didnt get the mashed potatoes, polenta and plantains.  I had to ask for them mid way into our dinner.  We ran out of cheese bread and we didnt get new until we asked.  Usually dirty plates are picked out frequently, not this time.  Nobody checked in with us to make sure we were all set and didnt need anything.  A new waiter showed up after we asked where our waitress was.  Too bad because we come here often for special ocassions and food is delicious but we pay for high quality service too.  I hope this was an isolated event.  Thanks, Claribel",4," November 11, 2018"
621,This is a great place for Brazil BBQ. The salad bar is also amazing. We go there on every birthday of the family. They give 25 dollar gift on birthdays and it helps to get the price down.,5," November 11, 2018"

626,We love Fogo and try to go for one meal as a family each time we are in a city that has a Fogo.  We were in Boston for a Realtors' Convention and decided to do our last meal of the week at Fogo.  We were not disappointed.  The food was as good as the other places we have enjoyed the Brazilian cuisine.  The service was impeccable as always and a great time was had by all.,5," November 5, 2018"
627,"Disappointing.  I have gone before for special events and it was amazing!  This time - maybe because it was a Monday night? - was disappointing. Service (not the meat offerers) from the hostess who question my dining companion  regarding waiting for me to arrive and making them feel like they needed to wait outside - in the rain!, to waiting 20 minutes for the check.  Usually I look for a reason to go here but that won‚Äôt be happening to soon this time around.",2," November 5, 2018"
628,"Fogo de Chao Boston was great! It was sometimes hard to get our server's attention for drinks, but the food was very good. I would definitely recommend going early in the night to take advantage of more of the different types of meats, which they start closing down towards the end of the evening. The salad bar is excellent also - it has everything from salad to proscuitto and smoked salmon. I would consider going to Fogo de Chao to do just the salad bar. If you pay for the full experience, would recommend eating light on the salad bar and saving room to try all of the meat. Everyone from our table really enjoyed the experience and the restaurant WAS very similar to the branch that I went to in Brazil a few years ago.",5," November 4, 2018"
629,"A perfectly good night spoiled by really bad service! Main dishes were over an hour late. Waiters started clearing off table before main courses arrived. One of the guests in our party did not receive a menu. Waited over 30 minutes for waiter to bring check at the end. Initially he said that the restaurant will take care of the delayed main courses, however this was not reflected in the final bill. I felt embarrassed that I suggested this place for dinner in the first place.",1," November 4, 2018"

635,Didn‚Äôt enjoy it overpriced not worth it.,1," October 29, 2018"
636,"This is for meat lovers. The buffet is a mandatory in the menu and while the quality is good, there is nothing exceptional to it. The waiters are going around with a choice of meat on skewers. the more traffic in the restaurant the more likely to have just roasted pieces. This well cooked but the meat it self is nothing exceptional or tasty. however there is a large choice and all you can eat. The wine by the glass is OK but expensive for what it is.",3," October 27, 2018"
637,Another great night at Fogo - and our friends who were first timers thought so too!,5," October 27, 2018"

650,Fogo de Chao is always a good time. The salad bar has so many good thibgs that you are almost tempted to get a big plateful but you need to be saving room for all the vaeious meats the gauchos are bringing out. Excellent service from the staff. We will visit the Boston location again. It was our anniversary and they gave us a nice desert.,5," September 29, 2018"
651,"Just not the value for money any more. Only a couple of cuts of meat are of worth it, but their hard to find you have to ask. It's just pretty expensive. ($270 before tip excluding alcohol for 4 ) there are better place for dinner. Lost it's uniqueness.",3," September 29, 2018"
652,La √∫nica observaci√≥n es que todav√≠a no terminas de comer el corte que pediste cuando ya est√° el mesero encima de ti llevando otro corte. Deber√≠an de dar un poco m√°s de tiempo ya qu√© tal parece que quieren que termines r√°pido de comer para que te retires.,4," September 28, 2018"
653,Overall the experience was bad. The price paid did not represent the quality of the food which in turn lead to not taking advantage of the unlimited quantity of it. The steak quality was not good enough for a steakhouse that charges 55$ per person + additional charges. It was badly cooked and disappointing. The people working there were fairly polite but not very professional. Definitively not a place i recommend. I have had much better steak in Boston for the same value.,1," September 28, 2018"

660,"Based on the experience as a whole, I give it 2 stars. It was a birthday celebration and I made reservations weeks in advance. None of the requests I made in my reservation were followed. I asked for a round table but we were given a rectangular table and too many chairs. It made getting around and talking to my friends near impossible. <br/>As for the atmosphere, it was loud and I knew things would get chaotic once the prime dinner time rolled around. We started off telling our drink order to at least 4 wait staff. Not sure where the disconnect was but it was confusion about 1 bottle of sparkling water. This is not a great place for a romantic date or dinner party. I say this because you can barely hear the wait staff or the friend next to you unless you're screaming.<br/>The food was good but I felt rushed and did not have time to enjoy. Again, the noise level did not make the dining experience enjoyable but I understand it was a busy Saturday night. You start off with cheesy popovers and a visit to the Marketplace Salad Bar/rice and beans. Of course you go for the salad to be healthy then add some cheeses and meats. By the time you finish, you're half-way full. You flip your card over to green and the waitstaff start flooding over to your table to offer you cuts of meat. I could barely hear what cuts they were. I often asked or medium rare and well-done was given. <br/>The drinks took a while to come out. Again, the waitstaff apologized for the delays but it seemed like there were not enough staffed for the restaurant that was fully booked. We were confused on the whole at the buffet experience. For the price, I would say it is not worth it for a large group. It is a shame that my initial requests were not provided to us. Oh, and if you're seated before the rest of your party arrives, forget the host telling you where to go. A couple people in my party were left wandering this massive restaurant because the host did not tell them which direction their table was.",2," September 15, 2018"

She asked had we been there before-we told her not in Boston but we have dined at the one in Atlanta. She made sure our service was impeccable-even surprising us with a welcome to Boston desert!

669,"I was nervous about booking a restaurant that is essentially adjacent to a hotel -- the Westin Copley -- but this one turned out to be super.  It was expensive (around $100 per person with drinks and tip) but the food, which began with a magnificent buffet and was followed by endless skewers of Brazilian style meats, was wonderful.  All of the food was cooked to perfection.  Highly recommended!",5," August 27, 2018"
670,Terrible service when asking for drinks and alternative food choices. I think perhaps a language issue but not sure. Waiter gave me wrong information. <br/><br/>Salad bar has shrunk considerably providing fewer options for those who don‚Äôt love all of the meat. Premium meat options were pretty scarce and you had to ask for them special. <br/><br/>Quality of the food was fine.  And plenty of it.,3," August 25, 2018"
671,18th birthday for son. Made reservations for 10 people  on Open Table weeks before. Got there and they had no reservation. Luckily I had the Open Table confirmation etc.  They tried to seat us at a table for 12 right as you walk in where everyone is standing around and waiting. I said absolutely not. Eventually they gave us a decent table. The food was good as always and a hit with everyone. Good special occasion place.,4," August 24, 2018"

675,"For our first time trying this restaurant out, we were very impressed with the table-side servers. They were great at explaining the process and if we wanted medium-rare, they would remember us and come back to us with it. The waiting area at the front could use a better system as everyone just stands around in the middle of the restaurant. The hostesses were busy but could definitely work on being friendlier. I mentioned in my reservation online that it was for my boyfriend's birthday but there was no acknowledgement whatsoever. We didn't need anything but a simple acknowledgment or a little extra special attention would have been nice. Overall we had a good experience and I would recommend it.",4," August 17, 2018"

But the front of house is poor; you are kept waiting irrespective of your booking time and table availability (15 minutes in our case), the reception staff are surly and it is a poor first impression.

The second waiter was rushing to clean the table as soon as we left the circle cards red. They were not friendly at all. For a meal that cost us $450 it was the worse service ever. <br/><br/>As far as food I think they are overrated. Everything was really salty but then flavorless. This was my second time there and both times I left with a stomach ache.,1," August 9, 2018"

Before we left they dropped off 3 huge bones bagged and wrapped in tin foil. Simple gesture but very appreciated. Our dog cried she was so happy,5," August 4, 2018"
692,So wonderful! Always great food and service.,5," August 3, 2018"
693,"Dinner was delicious and so was dessert.  The issue I had was with the service (or lack of).  A meal that should've taken an hour to and hour and a half took at least 2.  We waited on drinks twice, dessert took ages to get and the bill was only tallied upon request after sitting for 15 minutes waiting.  I am not sure if they were shorthanded or if this is typical but just make sure you leave a lot of extra time to wait.",4," July 29, 2018"

697,The food and service was amazing.  The staff was very attentive to my brother‚Äôs dietary restrictions (he has celiac disease and needs a gluten free diet).  Also I had made a note on our reservation with Open Table that it was my brother‚Äôs 50th Birthday and the brought out desert with a Birthday note without me even asking.

701,I love their delicious meat selections and nice salad bar.,5," July 15, 2018"
702,"For the price charged by this restaurant, the service is abysmal! Our server was unfriendly and scowled at us every time we asked for something and constantly ""forgot"" about our requests. However the servers who served the meats at the table were great and attentive. The food is really bland and americanized so not flavorful at all like Brazilian food should be. Don't waste your money if you prefer taste over some fancy dining option that doesn't even deliver.",1," July 14, 2018"

722,"We have been to a number of ""all you can eat"" brazilian grills before, this was the worst despite being the most expensive. The meat was not very tasty or even tender except for 2 cuts out of over 10. The amount of time we had to wait for our next server to bring more food was way too long, and by then we had lost our appetite already. We will not be going there again.",2," June 17, 2018"

My brother has been before and was extremely excited when I told him we‚Äôd be going for Father‚Äôs day. The food as usual was awesome, 10/10. The service is second to none. It‚Äôs like they have eyes in their back of your head, you plate is never empty, water never dry and drink of choice always topped up. Most excellent service, only a few other restaurants in Boston can compare too.",5," June 17, 2018"

The food was spot on. The ‚Äúappetizer‚Äù bar was delicious both times but the meat was just out of this world tonight. There was a lot of grunting and head nodding at the table tonight. Medium rare to perfection. Plenty of food came to the table. And our server Jessica was phenomenal. Every time she came over it was like she read our mind and knew exactly what we were just talking about asking for. We will be back soon!",5," June 16, 2018"

One can‚Äôt help feeling that they want you gone almost from the moment you take your seat. The only time you‚Äôll get any attention from the wait staff is when they get a whiff of an up sell opportunity. I won‚Äôt be going back.",1," June 9, 2018"
730,"Always good and always fun. Fresh table has ample, fresh and well prepared produce, cheeses, and meats. The reason to come here, though, is the meat....limitless offerings of perfectly cooked meat of many varieties. I learned a while back that they have beef ribs, but you have to ask for them -which we did! Love the yucca and fried plantains that they keep bringing, and oh, those popovers.....not cheap, but not outrageous either. I have spent more on meals that I enjoyed less. Not a regular place for us, more like a once a year indulgence which never fails to please.",5," June 9, 2018"

Overall the FOH team was very attentive and friendly.<br/> I wish a manager would‚Äôve come by and check on us specially because I wrote on my reservation it was our first time there and we were celebrating our anniversary.<br/> I‚Äôm definitely going to be coming back for sure.",5," June 9, 2018"

735,"The salad bar was very ordinary. While it had had a variety of fruits, and cold meats (why?), it did not have as many other options as before, or what I've had at other Brazilian places...<br/><br/>My other complaint -- I had indicated that it was a special occasion (my sons graduation) and there was nothing to acknowledge the occasion.  When making a reservation if I am asked about a special occasion, and I take the trouble to indicate the same, I expect some kind of acknowledgement.",3," June 3, 2018"

While we did enjoy our lunch very much, we expected to pay the listed price of $15.00 for each participants meal, however when the bill arrived, it was $26.95 and not the $15.00/each. I inquired of the server why the price difference and Carlos explained that on weekends, the price goes up. All in all, the  meal, service and location was great.",4," June 2, 2018"

I made a reservation a month in advance since we were going to be a group of about 12.  when we showed up I said I wanted to put the car Valet charges on the dinner bill and was able to quickly get that sorted for the entire party.  when we sat down the great service began, no pressure, just there when you wanted it to be. a couple of our party came later and that was no problem. Wine recommendation of 1.5 liter bottle was outstanding which we went through 2 of. I never indicated who the graduate was but the attentive service team just listening to conversations at the table knew who to bring out the special desert to without any direction. Really clever. All the food was fantastic and the meats were really top shelf. One knock in comparison to the Orlando restaurant was the lack of meat variety the Orlando restaurant came to the table with.",5," May 20, 2018"

It's definitely pricey, but I knew that ahead of time and saved for the occasion. There was a personal trainer/health freak in our group who doesn't eat meat, and he had plenty to eat and loved the food. We ordered him a salmon and he LOVED it. The waiter was wonderful, and I asked him to be discreet with the payment and he was just that. Everyone had a great time, I loved the food (favorites are the bread and the plantains which they replenish as we eat it. I also had the molten cake with ice cream (hot and cold dessert are my favorites). We didn't order drinks but I have in the past and there are some great cocktail options. I have recommended this place to everyone who loves meat!",5," May 20, 2018"

753,"The food is good, but for the price it could be better. The servers came around a few times then after about 45 minutes they stopped coming. The waitress did ask toward the end of our meal if there was a specific cut we would like. Overall we felt a little rushed.",4," May 19, 2018"
754,"This restaurant has once again lived up to its expectations. The kitchen produces a wide variety of perfectly cooked and mouth-watering foods that are perfect for special occasions.

755,"I have trevailed this establishment for as long as my daughter was a BU student and found it befitting to celebrate her commencement there. The food and service were way above anything that i could have possibly imagined nor expected. My expectations were surpassed. Of note-worth,  was a manager  by the name of ‚ÄúAna‚Äù who granted a ‚Äúroyal‚Äù experience. Was she ever engraciating  with her constant presence upon being informed that this was a graduation celebration. To be serviced by her and her staff again, we would surely travel from NY to Boston  time and time again!! . Thanks and accolades to Ana and her intuitive staff, who kept our plates filled and our palates wanting more. Never, have we had such attentive , first rate service, where the meats and market place were kept fresh, clean and  mouth wateringly  delicious!  Bless you all!!! Thanks all  for surpassing any expectation that we had and making the experience both enjoyable and memorable. We felt as though the staff celebrated along with us.

Having heard glowing reviews about the 5 star service at the other cities locations I was excited to give this location a try. The most disappointing part was the service. The wait staff are in serious need of training and proper hospitality management. In addition to this, the sides that come with the meat are brought out at weird times and were always cold. The meat that was brought around tasted very good, which was a saving grace for the evening. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a 4/5 star steak house experience. For the cost we paid for two we could have gone to a 5 star luxury restaurant and had a much nicer time.",2," May 9, 2018"

The rolls are amazing, but be careful not to fill up on them! Delicious cocktails also--especially the basil, ginger martini.  They don't rush you, which was nice because my family doesn't get together enough.  Easy to reach from Copley without having to set foot outdoors.   We will be back!",5," May 7, 2018"

One friend shared a piece of meat with anotber friend who wasn't getting meat and they jumped on us 2 seconds later to say not to share meat. The manager helped to mitigate but overall it's not worth the money.",1," May 5, 2018"
771,"My clients had eaten here before and really enjoyed the food and entire experience. That‚Äôs the good/great review from my guests which made me happy because as a business dinner it really is about them.<br/><br/>I on the other hand had read the reviews on TripAdvisor and Yelp so had mixed expectations at best but was game as I had never gone to a Brazilian Steakhouse and was looking forward to trying it.<br/><br/>Here‚Äôs my 2 cents: <br/>I go to a lot of good steakhouses and restaurants in general ... I can tell you at first bite if beef if prime or even good quality and this was neither. While many different cuts of beef come flying at you, each option was identical in flavor and the only difference was how tough the meat was... seriously, same flavor, different level of tough and yes, even the rare filet mignon was tough. I tried most of the beef cuts (though avoided what they called bottom as that‚Äôs for pot roast, isn‚Äôt it?) I took a bite of the garlic beef and bacon wrapped beef but these were the lowest quality cuts masked by bacon or garlic- I just couldn‚Äôt. <br/><br/>I was slow on grasping that my circle on the table was on green which ‚Äòmay‚Äô explain the rapidness of the servers but they came at all of us nonstop (even those with red side up) without leaving a second to breath and take in what was just put on the plate let alone eat it. I didn‚Äôt care for the speed of the meat experience at all and didn‚Äôt try the chicken, lamb or sausage so have no comment on those.<br/><br/>Did I like anything?!<br/> Yes, I really enjoyed the salad bar which has lots of options from meats and cheeses to all kinds of veggies, fruits etc.- I give their salad bar a solid 8.5. The cheese rolls on the tables were really tasty and they keep refilling them as well as several sides throughout the evening- all were good.<br/><br/>But this place should be about the meat and if you care more about quantity vs. quality this is a great place. I personally prefer a morsel of quality.",3," April 30, 2018"

While they got lots of attention, we were ignored by servers for long periods of time. If you want to stuff yourself on less than the best food, it's a good choice. However, I won't be going back unless someone insists. I can get a better meal with better service for the same or lower price at a lot of other places.",4," April 8, 2018"
802,Never a disappointment at Fogo de Chao. Exceptional service and food and never rushed! A must for those who have never experienced it.,5," April 7, 2018"
803,"Service never disappoints.  Arrived about 30 minutes early.  Waited a few minutes, and then was seated, which was appreciated.  Table rolls are ridiculously good.  Salad bar area is fine, but meats brought to the table are where it‚Äôs at.  Everything was terrific, with the exception of the lamb, which was a little tough.  House specialty sirloin continues to be terrific.  All of the chicken varieties were equally as good.  It is expensive, but worth the splurge every so often.",4," April 7, 2018"
804,Food selection and quality was excellent as always. If you like quality meats and a lot of it this should be the definitive spot for you.,5," April 7, 2018"

808,Amazing experience! superb service and food,5," April 5, 2018"
809,Overall this place was ok.  But over priced for what you get and the quality of the food.<br/>It wasn‚Äôt 1 Star. But definitely will not return.,3," April 3, 2018"
810,Excellent food and experience. Probably overpriced by about 25% but worth experiencing at least once.,4," April 2, 2018"
811,"We were rushed from the moment we arrived (server asking us about drinks before we took our coats off and sat down). Then after salad course we had to get our own plates for the meat round. The first few passes of meat were all on the well done (and tough) side  and no server asked us how we wanted our meat prepared. The later rounds were much better.<br/><br/>But as I stopped eating (red tag) and my husband continued (green tag) servers were at our table almost every few minutes asking us what cuts of meat we were ""waiting"" for. It was very intrusive (and clear we were being pushed out!) Not to mention we asked for some cuts as many as 3 times and they never arrived.<br/><br/>I've eaten at the Fogo in Indianapolis several times and never experienced anything like this. This was my third time at the Boston location and it may be my last. The price point for this restaurant is too high (used to feel like fine dining) to have a rushed dinner. Which is unfortunate because the concept is good and the food is usually very good.",2," April 1, 2018"
812,Great option for Brazilian barbecue!!!,5," April 1, 2018"
813,Easter brunch‚Äîit was perfect in every way. Service and food were both excellent!! We love it there!!,5," April 1, 2018"
814,"If you like MEAT, this is the place! <br/><br/>Tons of meat from ribeye to sirloin to lamb chops just keep comin‚Äô at ya, plus a salad bar with a great variety of veggies and fruits. <br/><br/>Will definitely come back here for a good cheat day :)",5," April 1, 2018"
815,"We had a lovely time celebrating our anniversary at Fogo de Chao. The staff was welcoming, warm and friendly- and for our dessert they were so sweet to pay attention to the reservation notes and wrote a beautiful ‚Äúhappy anniversary‚Äù on our plate! Love!!!! Thank you!!!",5," March 31, 2018"
816,We always enjoy our dinners at Fogo.  The staff are just wonderful and are happy to see us.  The food was top quality as usual.  We will be back.,5," March 31, 2018"
817,"Was pretty disappointed by the food. No variety of flavor. Everything was salty, I wish there was some more flavor. Also a lot of the meat were dry. Ironically, the best meat they had was the chicken wrapped in bacon. I came in hyped up, and left disappointed.. Won't be coming back :(",2," March 30, 2018"
818,The food was really good.,5," March 30, 2018"
819,Great fresh food,5," March 29, 2018"
820,"We like Fogo de Chao a lot. The restaurant week menu fit our budget. We really enjoyed the buffet which wasn‚Äôt simply a salad bar, but included everything from cheese to fruits and vegetables. And the charcuterie of meats was excellent!",5," March 29, 2018"
821,Delicious food. Amazing all you can eat salad bar. Excellent service. The pao de quejio alone is worth the trip,5," March 29, 2018"
822,"Meat lovers will enjoy. Lot of meat,  though some meats for me were a bit chewy, too burnt  and with fat- (Garlic steak). <br/>Would like to see some more meat options with chicken and lamb.",4," March 28, 2018"
823,"Went for Restaurant Week expecting the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised. Though the top meats were not included in the menu, my friend and I wondered how could we ever fit them in with all of the choices we already had. The staff was very friendly, the food bountiful and very good--especially the black beans!",4," March 28, 2018"
824,Great dinner night with friends.,5," March 27, 2018"
825,Overall this meal was a great meal and experience.,5," March 26, 2018"
826,"Good meal. It's always difficult to limit intake when practicing all you can eat, but that's not the restaurant's fault.",4," March 25, 2018"
827,Wait staff was very attentive.  Food was good.  We came for Dine Out Boston Week so the price per person was very reasonable.  Would definitely come back (for Dine Out Boston week),4," March 25, 2018"
828,"Restaurant week menu for dinner was only $38 compared to the usual $40/$55. However, the menu was limited, but we only prepared a few cuts of meat there over the others anyway so that did not bother us at all. Their salad bar and side dishes are always really good. Drinks are a bit pricey but pretty good. What was disappointed was the desserts. I get that it was a part of the restaurant week menu so it was smaller. But we got really thin slices of cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake on a tiny plate with nothing else but a fork.",4," March 25, 2018"
829,Excellent food offerings. A bit crowded and noisy.,5," March 25, 2018"
830,"The food was great, the salad bar and the meat were fantastic as usual.  Being a Sunday brunch, there were a few more items on the menu.   Great experience and great value considering all the food, and service, you get.",4," March 25, 2018"
831,"We have been to Fogo on several occasions and to be honest, the last time we were there it was not that great. We decided to give it another chance and we‚Äôre not disappointed. Our waiter Rodrigo was outstanding and pleasant, the food was hot, delicious and cooked perfectly and we didn‚Äôt feel rushed. Great meal!",5," March 25, 2018"
832,My husband and I dined for my birthday... food was excellent as usual and staff were so friendly and accommodating.  Gaucho's preparation and presentation was on point.  This consistency and delishousness keeps us coming back.  Thank you Fogo de Chao!,5," March 24, 2018"
833,The food was delicious.  My party of 9 enjoyed the meat selection and the buffet.  We loved turning our card for more!!,4," March 24, 2018"
834,We loved this place! The service was fantastic and the food was amazing! Can't wait to go back!,5," March 23, 2018"
835,Food was very good. The dining concept is a lot of fun. The servers seemed a little distracted by a few large parties that were around us so things took a bit longer in that aspect. Other than that we had a good meal! The caramelized banana side dish was delicious!,4," March 22, 2018"
836,"If you're willing to spend, then Fogo will always satisfy.  Come for the food, stay because you enjoyed the food so much that you can't move!",5," March 20, 2018"
837,"food was awesome comes fast and hot.  the side dishes just kept coming which was great.  how ever the only complain I have is the service. we asked for water multiple times and in the end we got a bottle of water that was charged on out bill. when my guest and I went back up to the salad bar for a second round, no one came to pick up the old dish until we went for our 3rd round. I guess they were short staff but didn't seem to be too busy. service needs some work for sure however like I said food was great.",3," March 18, 2018"
838,"My husband and I went last Sunday, 3/18/18, to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary, and we enjoyed very much the food and the ambiance. The server was very nice. <br/><br/>I did‚Äôt give a 5 to the service and overall experience, because I wished they would have done something to  acknowledge this special occasion for us. Also, we had an inconvenience paying with a gift card, but at the end the manager was extremely helpful!",4," March 18, 2018"
839,Great food and service,5," March 17, 2018"
840,"Everything remains great at this restaurant.  The food was even better than usual, which is hard to do since so good to begin with.  Enjoyable and fun for a change from the usual restaurants.  Steak was perfect as were the ribs.  While the food is good the service was great as were Ana and Jonathon who are the best managers around!  They are lucky to have them.",4," March 17, 2018"
841,My husband and I wanted to celebrate our 11 year anniversary and we chose to have our Dinner at Fogo de Chao! We loved it!!! Such good food and great service! Worth the money we spent!!,5," March 17, 2018"
842,"I have gone to this restaurant many times for different occasions, and every time the experience is great. Make sure that you order a Brazilian drink caipirinha and leave some room for one of the best deserts ever. Crema de papaya with casis licour.  Great experience overall. The whole team does a fantastic job making you feel welcome.",5," March 16, 2018"
843,"Fantastic experience, great location in Copley, was seated right on time. My girlfriend has a dairy allergy and the manager Anna gave us a personal tour of the salad bar and walked us through the options and offered to bring out anything from the kitchen to avoid cross contamination.<br/><br/>The drink cart gentleman, Paulo, walked us through all of our options, when in the meal to have each drink and what region they‚Äôre from.<br/><br/>Food was fantastic and Anna offered to bring out some off menu items for us to try.<br/><br/>Everything was great, I‚Äôll be back.",5," March 16, 2018"
844,"It was a great experience to go to Fogo de Ch√£o. The food was great, the service was awesome. As soon as we got there they attended right to us and they sat us at a table that had a view of outside. It was my girlfriends birthday, so for desert they came out and sang happy birthday to her. It was lovely!!! I will definitely go again",4," March 15, 2018"
845,"The quality of the food is good. I like the sides, especially the roasted banana. Though I can see the meat is really good, but I don't a fan of it cooking style. It seems to be too dry for me. It a good try but I don't think I will come again.",4," March 11, 2018"
846,Excellent value!!!,5," March 5, 2018"
847,"I was disappointed. There were only 3 or 4 beef entrees.<br/>There were, however,  3 chicken entrees,  1 saugage entree , 1 pork entree as well as 2 lamb offferings.<br/>This was not what I have experienced in the past, nor was it what I was expecting.",3," March 4, 2018"
848,My vegan friend and I were at a conference. She indulged me by going to a steak house and I went to a vegetarian restaurant with her the next day.

850,"This was our first time here. Convenient because connected right to the hotel.  Seated fast and guided to an amazing salad bar with fruits, salads, meats and cheeses.  Then amazing cheese bread at the table.  The selection of meats brought to the table were unbelievable.. 16 different varieties from lamb, to chicken ,roast, filet etc.. all cooked to your liking. Also, side dishes of mashed potatoes, fries and fried bananas were brought out.   So much food for the money.  Service was also great.  Will definitely be back",5," February 24, 2018"
851,"My son's 18th bday--- great way to celebrate! Excellent food; however In years past the food bar was more varied with multiple tiers of different foods, incl seafood.  That was not the case on our visit. The food bar was obviously downsized. Also, attire has become more casual dining unlike my previous experiences where it was not as crowded (more dining tables now to accommodate more people). Prior dining was more elegant and quieter. Our waiter was wonderful  and was very attentive throughout our dinner.",4," February 24, 2018"
852,Wanted to experience and celebrate my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday here . It was a nice place and a different setting for us .,2," February 24, 2018"
853,"Brazilian Steakhouse is one of my favorite styles of Restaurants. They do a fantastic job at Fogo de Chao. I gave a few less stars because if you don't come ready to eat it's a bit pricey, but if you are hungry, you can easily make it worth your buck. <br/>The staff was fantastic, it wasn't just the servers with the meat that were making rounds, there was a couple of people in our section wandering between table checking on us.<br/>The salad bar is also fantastic, a vegetarian could enjoy this place just as much as a carnivore.",5," February 23, 2018"
854,"Everything was good, except that one of my friends ordered a glass of wine and the waitress kept coming as soon as her glass was empty and refilling her wine glass with the same wine without asking first as if it was a free refill! Four of us either were in deep conversation or out at the market table, so we  didn't even realize that, so she ended up having a few glasses of wine at the end of dinner and that cost her a fortune!",3," February 22, 2018"

860,"One suggestion. When you are recognized by Wine Spectator, it is important to advertise the correct vintage of wine you are selling on your wine list. When you advertise a 2010 Barolo, you shouldn't bring out a 2011 and act as if it is the same thing.",4," February 18, 2018"

862,"Great food , great service. you not leave hungry..",5," February 18, 2018"
863,"Fun place to eat with some really great food, and lots of it.  And very good service.  The ""food bar"" (it understates things to call it a salad bar) has a huge variety of salads, vegetables, sides, fruits, and starches.  That's the ""first course"", although you can go back as many times as you want.  Some of the dishes are really excellent and the variety is huge.  My wife felt she could have made a meal from this alone.  Then the waiters come around with the meats.  Each waiter has one or two, and there were maybe a dozen available.  Say yes if you want one, no if you don't, and they carve off a bit for you.  I had probably five, some good, some very good.  Again, variety and quantity were exceptional.  A few things might bother some people, but were minor to me.  It's a bit loud and the tables are close together.  Not every dish or meat is fantastic, so you tend to pick what you like and get more of it.  There was a mixup with our check and so we had a delay getting out.  The staff was all very friendly and except for the check things went smoothly.  A great place to eat and have an unusual experience.  Don't eat lunch before it!",5," February 17, 2018"

868,"The service is impeccable. I‚Äôve been to the Beverly Hills, CA location and the service here in Boston is three times better. The entire staff from the hostess to the waiters to the servers make you feel like you are the only table in the restaurant. I can say this of both times that I‚Äôve dined here on very booked nights. <br/><br/>And the food of course is delicious! Make sure to try and save some room for the mashed potatoes and cheese bread.",5," February 16, 2018"
869,"Absolutely amazing. Love it there. I was a little disappointed that there was no warm pasta as there have been in the past, but the rest of the food does make it for it. The potato salad at the salad bar was delicious. They had really fresh tomatoes; the plantains (the sides) were wonderful, and the bread is to die for. I didn‚Äôt have a problem when I asked for my meat to be well done (sometimes they only have medium or rare). The drinks were great. Waiters were always walking around, so we never had to wait long if we needed something. I love this place. Will return.",5," February 16, 2018"

887,"Steak is too dry, no matter what kind of steak on that day. Service and ambience are perfect, especially service. I made a reservation with note that there‚Äôs someone in our group having her birthday. She was served with a free papaya pudding, which is really refreshing after having a lot of meats, and that saved them from getting a 3 star. I gave them 4 stars actually because of this. However I still have to rate 3 star on food due to the dry steak.",4," February 4, 2018"
888,"The service is outstanding at Fogo de Chao, I cant say that enough. The manager and multiple waiters/waitresses are there to cater to you, and make you feel very special (especially since it was a date night!)... The meats were extremely tasty, and the self-service buffet was good too, I just wasnt expecting the buffet part, it threw me off guard... Great experience for a date, a dinner with your buddies, or with someone you want to impress.",5," February 3, 2018"

893,"I've been to dozens of ""rodizio"" brazilian BBQ places, but in the two occasions I visited Fogo de Ch√£o in Boston I left with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth. Although I specifically stated I liked my beef ""very rare"" I kept rejecting meat that was medium-done at best. And only at the very end of my meal when I felt pretty stuffed I started getting the premium cuts like filet mignon.<br/><br/>Overall, next time I want good beef I will just stick to Ruth's Chris Steak House, by far my favorite place.",2," January 28, 2018"
894,Continues to be the best Brazilian Steakhouse in Mass.  Continually good food and service and a fun night out.  Ana and Jonathan are fantastic managers and the restaurant is luck to have them.

906,Very Good restaurant - great for a quick meal before the game! Moves quick! Lamb was the best meat. Wine options were great.,4," January 3, 2018"
907,"We celebrated a family birthday at Fogo. The meat is superb. We know to watch out for the excellent filet or sirloin and skip the cheaper cuts. The lamb lovers in our group flipped for the lambchops, which we had not had before. They were outstanding We love the popover-like rolls and the mashed potato that are delivered to the table.  The salad bar is good, but it was a frigid day and eating cold things was not as appealing as eating hot things. It's a pretty expensive meal considering nothing is cooked to order, but the novel presentation and the excellent meat keeps the carnivores coming back. It was convenient to valet the car; it was so cold that it was still on the curb when we got back. Considering it was about zero degrees, that was a nice bonus.",4," January 1, 2018"

911,"What a wonderful meal, ambiance, and waitstaff. I have dined here several times, and each one is better and better. The food and experience are truly exceptional, but the waitstaff is what makes this restaurant spectacular. Each person was so willing to help, kind, friendly, and positive. Clearly the team works well together from management to waiters and everyone in between. I can not recommend this restaurant enough, it is a must try!",5," December 31, 2017"
912,"The salad bar (aka, 'Market Table"") is really terrific. Some of the meats are superb, but the flow of meats is slow. I presume I could have requested one or two of the premium items I know I prefer, and asked for that server to come by more regularly...perhaps next time I will know and do that. <br/><br/>We also felt the decor was underwhelming. I would have expected big round booths and an overall more upscale decor. <br/><br/>The General Manager and asst GM are both extremely nice and attentive. <br/><br/>So, I'm torn...it's not wow...but it's pretty good, especially if you optimize it for your own experience.",4," December 31, 2017"

921,"I had dined here a few years ago and it was much better.  The place has since gone downhill.  The doors and floors were dirty.  The hostess and regular waitress were unwelcoming and seemed unhappy to be there.  The carving servers kept skipping our table which wasn't as accessible as others.  The food on the buffet was Sysco level, not gourmet.  When we ran out of rolls, the waitress never offered or brought another.  It was very expensive for such a lackluster dining experience.  We will not be going back.",2," December 25, 2017"
922,We had a marvelous Christmas dinner. The food and service were fantastic.,5," December 25, 2017"
923,Yet another stellar experience here. Christmas was stress free and enjoyable. Service and staff were impeccable. The food was delicious from beginning to end.,5," December 25, 2017"
924,This place was great and a unique experience. They did try to charge us $27 for our infant that didn‚Äôt eat anything. They quickly corrected the bill. Just something to double check.,5," December 25, 2017"
925,Its a great restaurant for brazilians feel at home,5," December 25, 2017"
926,"Really nice experience! Very good food, outstanding service.",4," December 24, 2017"
927,Good ‚Äòsalad bar‚Äô and very nicely done meat offerings.... however the close packing of tables and constant movement of patrons and staff make for a less than tranquil repast. Go hungry!,4," December 24, 2017"
928,Great service. We definitely ate more than the value for the buffet. Stay green,5," December 21, 2017"
929,Very unique - service was great<br/>Warm and cozy environment <br/>All the guests enjoyed the experience,5," December 17, 2017"
930,Solid service and quality that you expect from this establishment.,4," December 16, 2017"
931,My friends kept telling me I had to go eat there so we decided that as our Christmas get together we would. The food wasn‚Äôt that great and the price is super high for what it is.,2," December 16, 2017"
932,"We didn't realize that it was all you can eat style, but it's pretty neat. Get salad, rice and fruit from a bar, then sit down and use a card to signal whether you want meat offered to your table. Many steak servers roam around and will slice meat onto your plate on demand. Also highly recommend the chocolate molten lava cake (separate menu, but worth).",4," December 15, 2017"
933,It was a great experience! Complimentary dessert because of our anniversary,5," December 13, 2017"

935,We have been dining at Fogo de Chao since visiting Rio de Janeiro. Food selection is excellent.  Large salad/ fruit bar to accompany the variety of skewers of meat.,5," December 9, 2017"
936,Great all atound,5," December 8, 2017"
937,Food was excellent as was the service.  The ‚ÄòBrazillian Gentlemen‚Äô cocktail Is my new favorite.  The bill was $230 for 2 (3 cocktails each).,5," December 6, 2017"
938,"My husband and I went in for an afternoon lunch and it was a little quiet, almost like having the whole restaurant to ourselves!  The staff was very attentive and explaining the cuts of beef to us as they were coming around. Needless to say, my husband was swooning with delight over the service and the excellent lamb chops! Always worth going into Copley and going crazy looking for a parking spot! Kudos to your wonderful staff!!",5," December 5, 2017"
939,"The service  was wonderful - attentive, knowledgeable and pleasant. The market table is far, far above a salad bar with a rice and beans station and the best bacon I have ever tasted. All fresh and interesting. Serving the meat entree from skewer/swords is fun and offers a good variety with chicken, lamb, ribs and beef.  There is a fish option or market table only so all preferences are covered. The decor is restaurant 101 but that is a picky comment.",5," December 3, 2017"
940,A great way to celebrate grandpa‚Äôs birthday! Wonderful cuts of meat,5," December 3, 2017"
941,I've been to many restaurants in the Fogo chain. This is the best one. It's not just how good the food is. The spectacular service here is what sets them apart.,5," December 1, 2017"
942,Amazing food and attentive staff. A real experience!,5," November 30, 2017"
943,It looks like an attraction rather than a restaurant. Lots of large groups. <br/>We asked the waitress for an explanation of the differences in Malbecs (wine) and she told us they had different names. Duh! <br/>The meat was fatty.  The papaya from the salad bar was good but this restaurant is definitely not worth $55 per person.,3," November 28, 2017"
944,Food was great kids had a blast got a kick out of the meat servers. Our server Catherine was attentive and fun to have at the table,5," November 25, 2017"

946,Expensive but excellent food. Great for meat lovers.,5," November 24, 2017"
947,"We were here on the Thanksgiving day. The food was tasty and fresh. The meat was mostly well prepared and worth the visit. We enjoyed the food and the ambiance. Ask them in advance if they have discount for kids. Otherwise, they don't care and they bring you the full price.",4," November 23, 2017"
948,What a wonderful way to spend Thanksgiving. It was a perfect afternoon.,5," November 23, 2017"

950,Great service as usual,5," November 19, 2017"
951,Another great dining experience at Fogo!!!,5," November 19, 2017"
952,Very poor service. Had a long wait for drinks. Had to ask for potatoes and bananas that are usually put on table. Had to wait a long time for meats to be brought around. Al in all the service has gone way down hill from the last time we were there.,1," November 18, 2017"
953,"Well, we had reservations for 9:30. We asked for bottled sparkling water, was served the water in a broken glass. When we pointed it out, the glass was replaced but the water was not and we were never offered more water.  We felt that we were kind of rushed through dinner. We had to ask several times for the meats we wanted as we were repeatedly offered the same thing. I asked for coffees after dinner and was told that the machine was already off. Dessert was terrible. We received a check for $220. Honestly, it was awful dinner and service for such a price tag. Rushed and over priced isn‚Äôt the way to win repeat guests. If you want to close at 10, don‚Äôt accept reservations for 9:30.",1," November 14, 2017"
954,Exceptional Bralizian steaks and awesome salad bar,5," November 14, 2017"
955,"Fantastic meat. Seriously, fantastic. Best approached like you might a wine tasting: plan to try small amounts of meat, then go after full servings of the ones that really did it for you. Eat slowly, enjoy, and leaven with takings from the salad bar as palate cleansers. The cocktails are also splendid, to judge by the faces of my compatriots.",5," November 12, 2017"
956,We had the Brazilian Brunch and it was fabulous!  Great value!  The servers were extremely attentive as well.  They were on the sidelines and ready to go if we needed anything.  We will definitely return!,5," November 12, 2017"
957,Honestly my favorite place on Earth,5," November 11, 2017"
958,"The Food was absolutely delicious I would definitely recommend. My only complaint is that if it‚Äôs your first time it can be a little overwhelming, kind of wish the waiter explained how things work a little better. With all that said can‚Äôt wait to go back.",5," November 10, 2017"
959,Love Fogo.  We go monthly and always have a great meal with very friendly service.  Anna is awesome!,5," November 9, 2017"
960,Lower quality than past times.  Service was excellent,4," November 5, 2017"
961,"I've been to Fogo a few times and my husband chose this location for his birthday.  Not a big meat eater myself I chose the sea bass instead of the meat - the fish itself was covered in strawberries and mango and overly sweet and covered in citrus.  If you've had sea bass, you know it doesn't need much - salt pepper and a wedge of lemon will do wonders.  That and this time around none of our dinner party was impressed with the meat - the fan favorite was the chicken covered in bacon which is pretty sad if you ask me.  Overall think we won't be back to fogo and will instead will stick to your traditional steakhouse.",2," November 3, 2017"
962,"The meat here is to die for! The Market Table and full Churasco are outstanding. Only quip is that I didn't enjoy my lamb chop sadly. It was too well done. The side dishes, especially the cheese bread the polenta sticks are great! But don't fill up on those as there's unlimited meat circling the room. I love how quick the service is when I turn my card to green, but definitely remember to pace yourself.",5," November 3, 2017"
963,Service war bescheiden!,3," October 29, 2017"
964,"food was good , wish there was a better brunch selection- the waiter did take a very  very long time to  get my check and to return my credit card, a little disorganized as far as who was my waiter and why it took so long for the waiter (s) to come to my table  and to give me my check.",3," October 29, 2017"
965,It was my son's 21st birthday and we had a really great time and we loved the novelty idea of all you can eat prime meat along with a fantastic salad bar to accompany our dinner!,5," October 27, 2017"
966,Great restaurant. But I think I like Chima Brazilian steakhouse better. Tables were too close together and customers had trouble passing by our table. I don't like the garlic in the mashed potatoes.,4," October 25, 2017"
967,The staff was great and made the overall experience excellent!!! Thank you and keep up the outstanding work!,5," October 23, 2017"
968,"Food and drinks were pretty good.  Some meats were better than others; the picanha was outstanding while the ribeye was surprisingly tough that evening.  <br/>The service was incredible...we felt spoiled.  Everyone that we came in contact with seemed to go out of their way to be accommodating and helpful.  <br/>This was not an inexpensive meal, but the variety of offerings and the fantastic service was worth the visit.",4," October 22, 2017"
969,"We made a reservation via the OpenTable app. While we showed up a few minutes early we still checked in. It was a good thing the app sends an email almost immediately once the reservation is made. We had display the email to the front desk staff, and the manager, on two separate occasions in order to be handed a pager  which put us in line to get a seat. All this despite having made the reservation. The wait staff at the table were very helpful by comparison to the front ma√Ætre d‚Äô table.",4," October 20, 2017"
970,Service was good and food was great. I will return,4," October 20, 2017"
971,We have eaten in this place several times and this time was the best. The buffet was wonderful and the unlimited beef amazing. I dare not go too often as I always eat too much,5," October 20, 2017"
972,"This review is about the concept that Fogo De Chao have in serving their meat cuts. So they‚Äôll keep feeding you cheep cuts to make you full then send in their house special, ribeye and finally their filet and they give u small cuts from them too. So if you want something ask for it. And enjoy",4," October 18, 2017"
973,"The meat was outstanding!   The experience was unique as you get swarmed when you want meat versus not by using a green/red indicator.   I think it is great to try once, but if you like having a large selection of foods including high quality meat, this is the place to go!  Price was expensive per person.   My experience was nice but I think once covered it for me.",4," October 16, 2017"
974,Great meat quality. Bottom Sirloin and Picanha are a must have!,5," October 16, 2017"

981,We love this place!,5," October 7, 2017"
982,"Never disappoints.  Service is always terrific.  Flavors on the various beef, pork, and poultry was fantastic.  Wish they'd figure out a way to incorporate seafood into the mix, but not a showstopper.  Crowded place, even though we had somewhat earlier reservations.  Nice upscale meal.",4," October 7, 2017"
983,Great place for an upscale family dinner!  My family  loves it here and the staff treats everyone very well!,5," October 7, 2017"

986,"Good plentiful  food, very crowded and noisy.",4," September 30, 2017"
987,Lost the magic. I have been to fogo in Dallas and tried this Boston location.  It felt like we were in a cafeteria and the quaint Brazilian steak house feel was not to be found. Felt like we were just herded in and herded out.  Too bad because it could be a nice relaxing and fun experience for a family.,2," September 29, 2017"
988,"The food was well-seasoned and hot and tasted so fresh. The staff was extremely friendly and attentatuve. The manager , Anna, was vigilantly stances in plain view and I noticed she served customers, upon their behest,  food from the marketplace . It was such a top notch visit to a well crafted restauaght.  My daughter would love to host her 2018 BU graduation there. Impeccable flavor,  and service. It far exceeded my expectation.",5," September 25, 2017"

995,"I have eaten at Fogo De Chao in different cities (DC, New York).  I always enjoy my meal. This Boston, location was my least favorite.  The service, sides, amenities, were not as good at this location.  I would not go back to the Boston location.",3," September 16, 2017"
996,It was just awesome.,5," September 16, 2017"
997,"Been to this restaurant three times.  First time was wonderful (a graduation), second time was a business affair (very nice too).  These two prior times there seemed like there was more of a selection of meats.  The third time not as impressed.  It's very expensive and you need to love meat.",3," September 15, 2017"
998,"As usual, the food and service are outstanding.  An enormous lunch buffet was enjoyed along with the table carved meat  (lamb for me). Enjoyed a white wine blend also.",5," September 13, 2017"
999,It was ok. I had told the restaurant that it was a birthday in the reservation but no mentioned was made about it. The other thing I really thought it was ridiculous is that e even though they have a price with meet or without for adults - they don't have this for kids so kids pay 1/2 price but of the full amount even if they don't eat any meat.,4," September 10, 2017"
1000,"Utter disappointment. This is our third try in as many years and it will be the last. While the Fogo de Chao in Dallas was great every single time (and we went pretty frequently) the Boston location has never measured up. Our server was inattentive at best and there were long stretches of time between gaucho's coming to the table, even with all cards turned to green. At one point we waited more than 15 minutes for someone to pass by with food, but even the meats were largely uninspiring. Considering the cost, I would expect the service and the food to be much better.",3," September 9, 2017"

1004,"Food great, love the idea<br/>Service was sub par, probably cuz of the numbers<br/>We had a waitress with curly hair that probably didn't want to be their, it's hard to have a good time when someone who doesn't at least act that they r happy they r waiting on u, serves u<br/>I'm sure it was a single incident, as I have went to them multiple times b4 and the service was superb",4," September 3, 2017"
1005,Awful service but food is good.,2," September 2, 2017"
1006,"Not cheap for a Brazilian meat joint but you do get quality cut like the bone-in ribeye and sirloin and filet.  Some of the meat was delicious but once they move away, the next one tend to be disappointing",4," September 2, 2017"

1008,Perfect in every way!,5," August 26, 2017"
1009,"It felt like being on a cruise ship as opposed to a nice steak house.  Long lines around the ""market table"" and tables are packed very close together. Sides were eh, salad bar was eh, if you are someone that enjoys all cuts of meat and wants to eat $60 worth that is the only appeal to this place. They did offer a nice complimentary dessert because we were celebrating a birthday and overall service was very good.",2," August 24, 2017"

1020,"Excellent lunch with my team here.   The locations is well appointed, close to the duck tours which we did that day as well.  We also enjoyed all the salad bar choices and the quality of meats.   Its a bit pricey but not if you are a carnivore :)  They had a great wine list and the service was excellent.  Our waiter was personable, and professional.  He also didn't mind taking some group pictures for us.   I want to return with my husband.",4," August 16, 2017"
1021,"Everything was cooked to perfection and the table staff was pleasant and attentive. The carving staff was slow however and had we not had to ask the manager for certain meats to be brought around, then I would have given them a big 5- oh!",4," August 15, 2017"
1022,"My girlfriend and I went during restaurant week and were extremely disappointed. Right off the bat we asked the waitress to repeat the directions about how Fogo worked and when to turn over the coaster(Yes, it was our first time). Our waitress was both extremely quiet and it was obvious English was not her first language. <br/>My girlfriend told the waitress she was allergic to tree nuts. She responded with ""I will go get"" at which point we looked at each other with a confused look, go get what?  The head waitress came over to explain which options were gluten free at which point my girlfriend explained again she was allergic to tree nuts, not gluten. <br/>The salad bar was nothing special however the meat was great, when they came by with the good stuff. We felt like it was hard to get what you asked for. I had asked for more of a specific meat which was right next to us at the time and the gentlemen took the meat and walked away. <br/>We had also ordered drinks and finished them midway through our meal. We were never asked if we wanted another round(which we did). After a few minutes we decided we would finish up and go somewhere else for a drink after. <br/>We were extremely unimpressed. When you price your restaurant at $50+ a person expectations are higher than normal. I would have preferred to spend more on a nicer restaurant on Boylston or less for a better atmosphere on Newbury. Especially considering Fogo looks out towards the fairmont Copley plaza but they has the curtain pulled shut and it felt like a banquet hall. Won't be back. Won't be recommending it.",2," August 15, 2017"
1023,"Excellent food, attentive service",5," August 14, 2017"
1024,"We visited Fogo during Boston's most recent restaurant week, which might easily explain the OUTSTANDING value rating. Unlimited meat service, a freshly stocked and rotating salad bar, dessert, and amazing service to boot... for only $38 a piece! Very impressed",5," August 14, 2017"
1025,Went with my mum and two of my friends. I like the cheesecake!,4," August 14, 2017"
1026,Brilliant! Such amazing service and the food was just fantastic.,5," August 13, 2017"
1027,"We ordered from the regular menu.  All of the food was great quality.  Delicious.  Marketside bar was outstanding and many delicious choices.  Black bean stew was fabulous!<br/>All of the meats were flavorful, tender and served so beautifully.  We liked the red and green circles which indicated to serve meat or not.  The sides at the table were beyond great.  The cheesy rolls, carmelized bananas and polenta really made the meal.  We were continually impressed.<br/>Waitstaff was always available and attentive.",5," August 13, 2017"

1030,"4 of us were there for the restaurant week. I moved here from Denver and wanted our friends from Boston to try it, so the restaurant week was a perfect opportunity, but the selection was not like what I had expected.

1032,Catching up with old friends,5," August 11, 2017"
1033,"This was my first stop for Boston's Dine-Out during the month of August. I initially thought it would be a sit down service, but found out that it was more like a buffet, which I didn't mind. We were seated quickly and was told everything we needed to know for the restaurant week menu. We were constantly asked if we wanted some type of meat when our signal coasters were flipped to ""Yes""; our plates were never empty. I had a bit of the veggies and fruit -- I liked how fresh the pineapple was. Most of the cuts of meat were too fatty and/or large for my liking. My favorite cut was the prime top sirloin, which was cut thinly and had the most flavor. The meats were seasoned alright and we were finished eating after 30 minutes. The Pao de Queijo (cheese bread) had me grabbing seconds and the crispy polenta was delicious. We waited for a while for anyone to acknowledge that we were done... I got the chocolate mousse cake and my boyfriend got the key lime pie for dessert, and they were the thinnest slices of pie and cake I have ever been served... They were only centimeters wide, but I guess it's okay because we were super full already? Not sure if that was because we were ordering from the Dine Out Boston menu or not, but it left a pretty bad impression.<br/><br/>Speaking of bad impressions, I felt like I was going to get stepped on / walked into heading to the washroom... and unfortunately, I did. A server rushing to get somewhere stepped on my foot and the side of my shoe while I was going back to my seat. He looked apologetic but continued on his way. I looked down and I noticed that the side of my shoes were totally scuffed with black marks (the bottom of my shoe is white) and some parts of it were scrapped off... I used a magic eraser to try to clean it off, but my shoe is still damaged. All in all, an okay experience. I don't think I will be coming back here again. It's a great novelty restaurant though if you've never gone to a Brazilian steakhouse.",2," August 11, 2017"
1034,Didn't do anything special for the special occasion,4," August 10, 2017"
1035,"The food was good, however they really need to work on the service. Took 20+ minutes to get sides. Some meats only came around once, and that was only after specifically requesting them.",3," August 10, 2017"
1036,Not the best Brazilian steakhouse I've been to but it was a good meal none the less.  Only thing with this spot and most other places like this is that you can sit with an empty glass for an hour.  These places would make so much more money if they keep glasses full.  Maybe employe a few more bartenders.,3," August 10, 2017"
1037,"I have visited all Fogos and the service and management here was by far the worst, as I faced all sorts of attitudes and was even given lectures too.<br/> <br/>1-I asked if they can make fresh chimichuri, answer was NO. I said ""OK, can I have your available chimichuri then?"", 30 minutes passed and no chimichuri. <br/>2-I shared my preference for well done red meat upfront. 20 minutes passed and no meat, when I reminded a meat guy about my request for well done lamb and beef he lectured me by saying ""Lamb is very popular and I have to make sure other people get some too""! <br/>when he finally brought meat he just stood by my table with his back toward me and not talking or looking at me, just waiting for me to grab a piece of meat from his skewer. <br/><br/>Finally I complained about not getting the chimichuri, at that point a managers showed up and to her I also shared the attitude of the meat guy. This manager said she make fresh chimichuri for me, which I declined because I said ""I never force a chef to do something for me that he has refused to do in the first place"".<br/> <br/>Then all she did was insisting that I should come back later to see how nicely they treat me NEXT time. REALLY, you are not willing to offer anything in my current visit to rectify this terrible experience and instead you want to secure more business for yourself and earn a second visit of mine by just giving me nothing but words? How about offering a free drink, or dessert or taking 25% off of the not so cheap price that people pay for a supposedly fancy experience?<br/>This was poor management on top of terrible service.",1," August 10, 2017"
1038,Went for Dine Out Boston. They served their regular menu minus a couple of the steak options. Food was excellent. Not sure would be worth the normal $58 price but fun meal. A bit noisy but that might have been due to the reduced price brought bigger crowds.,4," August 9, 2017"

1043,"I love a good Brazilian steakhouse and this is one of the top spots in Boston. The staff serving the different selections of meat were a little slow getting around to our table but we went during restaurant week so keep that in mind. . Food was tasty and overall the service was good.   Would definitely go back but given the prices, can't say it will be a regular thing.   There is another spot I like a lot that is a tad less expensive.",4," August 6, 2017"
1044,"Our Waiter ignored us after giving us the drinks list, it took 15 minutes to get drinks service.<br/><br/>The meat was variable with some chicken perfect but other times was overcooked and dry. Some steak was likewise perfectly cooked but other times dry and overcooked despite my request for medium rare.",3," August 5, 2017"
1045,"I have been to other Brazilian barbeques, but  Fogo is absolutely outstanding.  The staff couldn't be nicer; food so delicious; salad bar had so much to pick from and the atmosphere was so nice.  Great place to go for any celebration.  Will definitely go back.",5," August 5, 2017"

1050,They went out of their way to get a certain meat my brother liked and wanted to have more. They even cooked up extra for him.<br/>I asked them to put a candle in my sister's dessert for her birthday and they wrote Happy Birthday on the plate for her too.<br/>Pineapple dessert delicious to top off everything.,5," July 30, 2017"

1055,"The steak (mainly the Picanha) was not good; service was terrible. At the end, I even asked for the manager to understand more about the meat (if it was indeed Brazilian) and the waiter said he was going to call him and never did. I've been to Fogo de Chao a few times in Boston, and many times in Brazil (in addition to other locations). It has never been so bad.",3," July 23, 2017"

1057,My wife and I ate at Fogo last Saturday evening close friends. All of us had an absolutely wonderful time. The servers were friendly and extremely competent and the food was exceptionally good. The enormous salad bar is a great experience and the grilled meats are exquisite.,5," July 22, 2017"
1058,"We have been to other Brazilian steakhouses in other cities and Fogo is one of the best.  The salad bar is outstanding with healthy and varied choices (a meal on its own), the meat choices are tasty and the service is excellent  Our waiter Gabriel was attentive and friendly.  When reserving, I noted my friend's birthday and unbelievably, Gabriel remembered and brought a dessert with a candle.  Great touch!  Very big restaurant but filled up quickly by 730 pm on a Saturday night.  All sorts of patrons .. families with young children, party groups and romantic couples dressed both fancy and casual.  Will definitely return but probably save this feast for special occasions.   Highly recommended!",5," July 22, 2017"
1059,This was my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse and it was a unique and exceptionally fun environment in addition to having great food. My husband and I came for our anniversary and brought our teenage kids and  there was really something for everyone here!

Our servers were good. The primary server seemed a little unsure but was still good. A great experience!",4," July 15, 2017"

1065,Nice food but very poor service. Full table of dirty plates with no one cares to change. Only saw our waitress 2 times during the entire visit while she was serving another big table. Very disappointed service for the price we are paying. Would not return.,2," July 12, 2017"
1066,Very disappointed with the initial service. Waiting over 15 minutes and all we got was water. Couldn't even get any attention until we finally got someone to get our waiter. Never asked us for drinks. Just told us to get up and start to eat. We had dietary requests that we needed handled. <br/><br/>Food was good but the service really diminished the meal.,3," July 11, 2017"

1070,"Solid overall, food quality lower than in the past. Service excellent though.",5," July 9, 2017"
1071,"I've been here before but always with large groups. I went with my parents this time to really experience it and was not disappointed at all. The market table of salad options and some assorted cheeses is a great starter. The chefs that bring the meat to your table are very knowledgeable and accommodating. The biggest problem is trying not to eat too much. Absolutely great restaurant and would definitely encourage people to try it out, especially if they have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse.",5," July 9, 2017"
1072,"Although the restaurant wasn't busy when a friend and I visited early Sunday evening, lots of wait staff were eager to serve. Perhaps too eager! Dozens of times during the meal, servers came up to our table to check on us, and on a number of occasions, interrupted our conversations. In a restaurant of this quality and price range, I would expect servers to be trained to wait a brief moment for a pause in a conversation before jumping in, or perhaps stand near the table facing the diners for a few seconds where they could get the diners' attention. We chose the buffet-style salad bar, not the meat option, which requires far less table visits. I've never been checked on so many times in any restaurant at any price range. To be fair, the servers were polite, pleasant, and were clearly trying their best to do a good job. We also received a bill that included the more expensive meat option which we did not order, which also happened the last time I dined there. It was quickly corrected each time. On the plus side, the salad bar option was excellent, with lots of delicious choices.",4," July 9, 2017"

1075,"We were here for Fourth of July in Boston. It was a great night! The food was amazing, and even though there was not grilled pineapple served for dinner, Anna, the manager was so great to take some for my daughter and have them grill it in the back. The waiter made sure that the bill was set with a coupon for the kids! My advice is to ask the waiter or manager for any requests, the assistant that cleared the table and brings the bill didn't really have any information and wasn't helpful with any questions we had for special requests. Overall a wonderful dining experience for the whole family. Very welcoming to the kids and then whole family. Friendly and nice smiles, eager to please.",5," July 4, 2017"

1101,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. A bit overpriced but worth the splurge for a special occasion. I have been here several times and service is always outstanding. Food is always very good: a plentiful salad buffet, a decent cheese and cold cuts selection, and high quality meat with your choice of rare, medium rare, cooked. I said it already but will repeat it: the staff -including the hostess, wait staff, the servers, everyone- is very professional and friendly. Can't same the same thing about the valet since it took 10 minutes for someone to show up and take my car but to be fair it looks like they're understaffed. All in all a great place for dining, highly recommended.",4," June 14, 2017"
1102,"Staff was very attentive. Salad &amp; deli bar was excellent. Main course meats slightly variable but still clearly acceptable overall.

This place is supreme in service and each person we came in contact with had a kindness and care that truly is rare in this industry. The food was exceptional the drinks were spot on. It was a lovely family graduation dinner and we'd go back next week if we could. What's great about Fogo is the choice that's given and the selections are so wide anyone can be happy here. The salad bar is bountiful and the meat and cheese selection allows you to personally curate a meat and cheese plate better than any restaurant appetizer. I especially loved the fig jam. Of course the star of the evening was the meat service. With choices of done ness for every person in the group this was a great fit for our large party. I prefer medium under and what I had was outstanding.  Can't wait to go back on a date, in the bar to meet up with friends and will prob plan our next private room graduation dinner there next year as well.",5," May 25, 2017"

You have these little discs on your table. If you turn the disc to the green side, the ""gauchos"" come to you with large chunks of meat on skewers--top sirloin, bottom sirloin, filet of beef, strip steak, leg of lamb, pork chops, chicken, ribs. They carve a piece for you, and they ask how you want it ( rare, medium, etc. ).  You then grab the piece with your little tongs. It's fun. We were both stuffed when we left. Vegetarians have the option to just do the harvest table. All in all--a real hoot!",5," April 22, 2017"

1172,"Simply fabulous! My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner.  Wow! This is the best dinner I've ever enjoyed.   We had a fabulous night out in Boston and enjoyed a truly perfect dinner at Fogo. Best of Boston!  Everything was perfect from beginning to end. Not only is the food exceptional, but the service was supberb.  George was our waiter  and he was simply wonderful too!  In fact the whole staff at Fogo must be commended on how professional and attentive they are toward their customers.<br/> Anderson the general manager at Fogo personally came over to  our table and brought us a delicious dessert for our anniversary as  a surprise.  Anderson went above and beyond,  he is truly an asset to this restaurant.  <br/> So if you want exceptional food,  fantastic service at a beautiful place, get to Fogo as soon as possible.",5," April 1, 2017"
1173,The waitress who lead us to our table not too friendly nor present either. Only check on us once. Cheese bread was cold. My husband had to get up and find a host to pay bill because we were done eating and she never came to check on us. We waited for a long time...,3," April 1, 2017"

Unfortunate since my parents came from out of state to dine here!",3," March 28, 2017"

1178,So disappointed in this experience.  We felt rushed through what we thought would be a great dinner experience.

1190,"This isn't a steakhouse as much as an ""all you can eat"" place.  The food is pre cooked not cooked to order.   There is a large salad and bread table.  Meats are brought to the table in large pieces and portioned out in slices. The meat is overcooked, not flavorful, not the same quality as in a regular steakhouse.   The price is the same as most of the top steak houses -- very overpriced.",2," March 5, 2017"

1192,"I come here with my family for special occasions and the past few times has been wonderful! However, on my  most recent visit (for my birthday), the meat that they served were very burnt and dry. The waitress/waiters kept forgetting to bring the tea that my grandmother had ordered. I understand that it can be very busy at times but we waited for over half an hour and asked two different waiters to bring over our tea and still no tea was delivered.",2," February 26, 2017"

1194,"Nice service but food is terrible. One can clearly notice that meats have been passing around for a long time, are dry, and some even burned. As a regular of this chain (Ny, texas, Florida), this restaurant does not stand to standard. Besides the pao de queijo and the flan, absolutely everything was forgettable. Will not come back or recommend.",1," February 25, 2017"
1195,Very noisy with snobby service. You get full faster than you eat your $50 worth of everything. The Farmers Market table is one step away from the Olive Garden salad bar. This is a gimic of a place. So many other steak houses that are worth a better bang for your buck. They don't even let you take the Pao de Queijo home!,2," February 25, 2017"

1197,"Once again we had a terrific meal at FdC. <br/>Everyone was so kind, helpful, and we enjoyed ourselves. <br/>Our favorite lamb chops kept coming, along with the other delicious meats, and the servers took excellent care of us.  <br/>There was also a very tasty sweet potato/ butternut squash soup today.  Yum!<br/>Awesome place to go for a wonderful meal.",5," February 21, 2017"
1198,"I've been to other locations for this restaurant and the experience has been very nice. So I had high expectations for the one in Boston as well.... <br/>The management sucks here with inattentive servers and repetitive food selections. Terrible NY strip and garlic steak, and the rest were just mediocre. Save your bucks and go somewhere else.",2," February 19, 2017"

1203,The food was delicious and the service was excellent.,5," February 14, 2017"
1204,"My husband and I had enjoyed the Rio location of this restaurant and decided to try the hometown location for a Valentine dinner.  Fogo de Chao is an excellent dining venue for a meat lover. All the cuts of meat were piping hot  and were cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning.  Items on the salad bar were diverse and very fresh. Service was attentive and valet parking is very convenient. My only complaint was that the tables were very close to each other and it was difficult maneuvering around the tables to get to the buffet table.  All of this comes with a hefty price tag; dinner for 2 with 1 cocktail apiece, parking and tip, total about $200.",4," February 14, 2017"

1215,"Very under impressed. I wish they gave an option for warm appetizers and warm sides. I hated that everything was cold. We had a table of 8 adults and they gave us two sides of mashed potatoes to share with were were in tiny dishes, we each could have eaten our own. I have been to many Brazilian steakhouses before and I prefer being able to have the option of the ""buffet-style"" all you can eat steak or a menu option to order from. Our whole party was unimpressed with the lack of warm food options other than the soup. If you wanted the meat ""medium well"" or ""well done"" , you always ended up with an end piece that was tough. The staff is great but did not make up for the poor food. This restaurant is mediocre at best and I would not choose to dine here again nor would I recommend this.",3," January 28, 2017"
1216,Great place to eat if you are a meat lover. It's very well seasoned and they have lots of options to choose from.,5," January 25, 2017"

Otherwise if you're not up tight and have to have everything when you want it then you'll enjoy it. I have my office party there every Christmas when I invite 100 people to dinner. So, I guess I like this place!",5," January 21, 2017"

1224,Great salad bar - very good meat. We chose this place for my son's 9th birthday and he loved it...I've been before and would have loved it more except that my wife and I are working through the Whole30 diet and there are a few things you can't eat (ask for their allergies menu) but that's us not the restaurant - overall - very good if a little pricey,4," January 14, 2017"

1227,"Although dinner hour is wonderful, there is a great bargain at lunch, if you don't crave lots of meat. The ""market table"" buffet has every salad, appetizers, smoked salmon, cheeses, salami, soups and even a side board with a meat. It was only $15 here in Boston. For meat lovers, a bevy of wait persons go around, each with a different sort of meat on a skewer ( there were around 8 different sorts, but I lost count.)  each and every bit of each and every food was outstanding, as were the efficient and warm staff members.",5," January 2, 2017"

1234,"Fogo de Chao is an experience! Lots of great food starting with an expansive mind boggling salad bar, second to none. Vegetarians like myself would find themselves very happy just enjoying the salad bar. The rest of your friends and family will enjoy the incredible meat selection, generously offered. The trimmings are also great-polenta sticks, plantains, cheese puffs especially! My only negative is the EXUBERANT COST OF WINE! There is NO justification. A simple bottle of white wine (retails $13 at the liquor store, was $57). All of their wine costs seem greatly overinflated. It takes away from the experience.",4," December 25, 2016"

The staff were keeping it regularly topped up and clean.<br/>The meats being brought round the table were rather variable.  I thought the short rib and lamb chops were awesome, but several of the steak cuts and the leg of lamb were rather tough and/or tasteless.  Also, if you get the outside slice of meat, it's very salty.  But overall, it's decent value and a fun place to go for something different.",4," December 3, 2016"
1249,"I have been here several times and the food and service are also beyond excellent. This time had a great waiter name was Odrigo (don't know if I spelled that right). He always  checked up on us to make sure everything was okay and I remember went out of his way to explain and grab me one of the special Brazilian sodas. Working at Apple, customer service is the most important thing for me and Odrigo went up and beyond to take care of our table and hopefully he can get recognized for his great work especially after only working there 3 months. Will ask for him next time I come back in!",5," December 2, 2016"
1250,"Great food and lots of it.  If you're a meat lover, this is the place to go.  My only comment is that there isn't always a good delineation between meat temperatures.  I.e. - you are really at the mercy of what's been cooked on the stake.  You can't get a rare and a medium well from the same stake.  This is what we observed from our table.<br/><br/>The salad bar was excellent as well.  We had no room for dessert.  My only feedback is that I wish there were different steak sauces available.  Also, no free refills on the soda?  Really???  You guys need to take care of the designated drivers...",4," December 1, 2016"

1255,"Not the first time here. But tonight, thanksgiving night, they claim they would close at 10:30pm as normal. But the stuffs were started to clean up the place while customers are still eating at 9:30pm. And the buffet bar was closed at 9:50pm",3," November 24, 2016"
1256,"Given that they advertised that thee would be a Thanksgiving part of their usual Brazilian grill menu, I wasn't impressed, with the Turkey etc.  I have been here before and the grilled meats are outstanding.  I was just looking forward to Turkey, stuffing, potatoes and cranberry sauce.  I wont be going her for Thanksgiving in the future.",4," November 24, 2016"
1257,Fogo Boston has never been up to par of majority of Fogo's we have been to.  But it is still a Fogo and is the closest one to us. <br/>Yet again my lamb chops never arrived despite multiple requests. This has happened the previous few visits. And they seem to only bring 4-5 cuts over and over while the rest of the 16 cuts need to be requested. This visit noticed all the meets were not salted. <br/>Overall not as good as Other fogo's but still a good place to go.,4," November 24, 2016"
1258,"Food was good.  Service not that good.  Our waitress was fine, disappointed with the selection.  Seemed like same people were coming to our table with sam meats, maybe 5 options.  Had to request few time for certain meats to be brought to our table.  Otherwise good experience.",3," November 24, 2016"
1259,"We reserved a table for Thanksgiving and arrived early.  We were seated promptly.  We were told the staff works ""as a team"" which led to a lot of confusion as to who was taking our drink order or who to ask for a refill.  We had at least 6 different people wait on us.  The salad bar was disappointing as it was mainly ""brunch"" items and no real Brazilian food was on it.  There was a lot of fruits, meats and cheeses but not very many Brazilian dishes at all.  The meat service was prompt, which made my husband very happy.  This was a so so first time here until I took my daughter to the restroom. Then it got ugly.   In the larger stall there was a pair of ladies underwear and a bottle of lotion on the floor and one of the other stalls was covered in toilet paper.  I really had expected something more, I suppose.  After we got back to the table, I really just wanted to leave and we had to ask several people for our check.  When we received it, I had been charged for the meat service, which I did not get and there was vodka on it that we hadn't ordered.  <br/>Pros- the host staff was pleasant and on point. <br/>Cons- pretty much everything else.",2," November 24, 2016"
1260,"Le principe est assez particulier. Vous avez un buffet de salade et garnitures diverses peu en rapport avec la cuisine br√©silienne : saumon !!!<br/>Pas de plats br√©siliens pour accompagner la viande qui va √™tre propos√©e.<br/>Le plus fort est que vous ne choisissez pas une viande comme dans un restaurant classique, l√† des serveurs viennent vous proposer differents choix de viandes que vous acceptez ou refusez.

1262,"I reserved a table for 7 for 6 p.m.   My friends (six black females) arrived before me and was told our reservations was for 7 p.m. not 6 p.m.  Although we were seated at 6 PM, in the center of the room, we were ignored most of the time. The waiter did not explain the difference in the menus and prices nor give us drink menus.  My friend did not know she could have ordered salmon. He did not explain that dessert was not included.  We were in the middle of dinner before we were able to get a cocktail.  The waiter never came back to ask if we wanted  another drink.  We had to ask waiters to have the servers come over with meats.  Most of the time they walked right pass our table with meats.   For the cost of dinner, it was a very bad experience.  Will never go back.",2," November 20, 2016"
1263,This is as good as it gets. I've been to almost every location they have and this is one of the best for sure. Highly recommended. Impeccable service and high quality meats.,5," November 18, 2016"
1264,Horrific! We dine at expensive places this place was maybe worth a $15 buffet. The quality of food was horrible. I have had much better at an all you can eat Brazilian buffet,1," November 18, 2016"
1265,Fogo never disappoints. <br/>Excellent service and superb food. Friendly atmosphere and great place to celebrate a birthday. <br/>My only negative is the valet parking. Remove all valuable s from your vehicle. It is an independent company I believe but we have had issues more than once. Don't let that deter you from this great restaurant though,5," November 18, 2016"
1266,"While the concept is interesting, the food and service were lackluster. Our server who greeted us sounded completely unenthused to be there, which leaves any diner unenthused to enjoy their experience. The meat was decent, but often too salty or tough. It felt like a corporate restaurant with no soul, and clinging onto the only decent part of the experience, which is the gentlemen slicing hot steak at the table.",3," November 13, 2016"
1267,"Great spot, great service and  great food.",5," November 13, 2016"
1268,"My waiter was not attentive. We had to asks for stuff with many other staffs walking by and waited long to get simple things like a glass of juice or our side dishes with no cheese. I could hardly understand what the guys carrying the diff type of meat were saying but that is ok. I was more concern with I had to wait long for anything I'd asked for when this place is fast pace, in the city, huge area with plenty of staffs. I would asks if all waiters could check in with their table more which means, if I asks for juice or whatever it is, that u don't have me waiting 5-10 mins for it. I hope the next time I come in I can leave happy.",2," November 11, 2016"
1269,"Great upbeat atmosphere with a casual and fun feel. Salad bar has a ton a variety and is authentic brasilian but the meat is what it is all about and it's a carnivores' delight. The coolest thing however, is that they make authentic caipirinhas which is the best party drink ever! If you to take a group for a fun social event with really good food and great brasilian drinks this is the place.",5," November 10, 2016"
1270,"It was our second time there and was perfect again, all the servers were very attentive to us, <br/>We were celebrating our anniversary and Ana our server make sure that we were having a great time ... she was awesome... we love everything from the beginning to end.",5," November 5, 2016"
1271,"Our server  Santiago had a genuine, caring attitude. He took pride in his work and was responsive to our needs.",5," November 5, 2016"
1272,I been to other chain Brazilian steakhouse and they were less in price and more in selection.<br/>We also had a table next door where the lady was very loud I guess she was a public speaker and forgot she was in a restaurant.<br/>So for my experience it was the most expensive loud restaurant ive ever experienced.,4," November 5, 2016"
1273,Who wouldn't love having meat brought to them on a sword and pointing out the cut they want?,5," November 5, 2016"
1274,"I absolutely love this restaurant! My fiance and I went here for our two year anniversary and we ended up getting a complimentary dessert with a candle to celebrate (so cute)! As always, the meat was fantastic and the market table (salad/cheese/fruit/etc bar) was incredible! Prepare to fill your plates and stomachs at this delicious restaurant (and wear a loose dress or pants that expand to handle your inevitable food-baby haha). Fully expect to pass out due to a food coma as soon as you get home :)",5," November 4, 2016"
1275,"We were seated promptly and service was generally decent, though it did take a few requests to order drinks. The seating was OK but somewhat cramped. The market table buffet offered a wide range of vegetable, meat, and cheese options (including some excellent lox!), all of which were very good quality. The side dishes and rolls baked with cheese were great also. The weak point was definitely the meat; multiple variations of beef were fairly tough and stringy and did not seem to be particularly prime cuts. The lamb chops were good. All in all a decent dining experience, but if I were to return I'd probably skip the passed meats if possible.",3," October 30, 2016"
1276,Not sure who the server was but he was excellent it was my husband birthday and he helped make it special by bringing out flan with writing words  happy birthday with a candle . Made the exsperience all the much better.,5," October 29, 2016"
1277,We came to Boston to visit our son in college.  He recommended the place as it is all you can eat meat and what could better for a college student.  The meat was fantastic as were the salads.  I highly recommend.,5," October 28, 2016"
1278,"A good friend is getting married so six of us met at Fogo De Chao for dinner as a last supper for our good bachelor friend.  In a thank you email to all of us the groom to be said, ""... and what a fantastic choice of a restaurant"".",5," October 27, 2016"
1279,OK but not more.I was disappointed about the variation of Meat and the service lever was not high I have definitly seen better!,3," October 26, 2016"
1280,"I had the wrong expectations here. You help yourself to the salad bar to start off. Everyone has their own coaster on the table that you flip to green if you want the waiters to bring meat, and red if you want them to stop bringing meat. For those of you that have been here you know this, but I had not and did not.  Not quite the upscale steak experience I was expecting, but a fun place if you know what you are getting into.",3," October 26, 2016"
1281,"Fogo de Chao has been my favorite restaurant for years, and every year, my boyfriend takes me there for my birthday. The food is always top-notch: best buffet I've ever had with a wide selection of vegetables and salads, and, of course, an exquisite and delicious meat selection. This most recent meal at Fogo de Chao reminded me that one of my favorite things about the place is the zero wait once you sit down, since you can just go up to the buffet as soon as you put your drink order in. This is great if you have kids, and also means you can eat an A+ dinner in a short amount of time if you need to, as you don't have to wait for food prep. Finally, what stuck out to me in particular this time was the exceptional service from the hostess and staff. The hostess came by several times to ask us how we were doing and how our meals were, and our waitress was also very attentive. I can't wait to come back.",5," October 24, 2016"
1282,Simply amazing!,5," October 24, 2016"

1286,This is our third time to Fago de Chao.  Food and service are outstanding.  Lots of fun too.,5," October 22, 2016"
1287,"Second time to this place. First time we like it a lot, now not so much..We felt rushed the entire time, we had to ask for the guys with the meats to stop by, the servers was on top of asking to clean our plates no stop. On top of all, while my friend was enjoying her desert, the bus was standing by our table holding a tray of dirty plates, watching her constantly. We felt so uncomfortable. More so, when you spend almost $500 for a dinner, you hope for a better treatment. I counted about 3 managers on the floor that night, but not one stop by our table to check on us. Second time will be last time for us.",3," October 22, 2016"
1288,"This Was an amazing experience to say the least! I would highly  recommended eating here. The atmosphere  was great, the food was amazing!  The wine  list was supurb as well as specialty cocktails! I enjoyed myself so much....the butternut soup was my favorite side dish...mashed potato as well of course! The meat......omg... was out of this world. .top sirloin melts in your mouth parmesan crusted pork...ribs...pork sausage. ...and the servers were so nice! I can't to go back and experience this wonderful restaurant again!",5," October 22, 2016"
1289,The food was amazing. <br/>The prices were high.<br/>Getting the check took a while. <br/>4/5,4," October 21, 2016"
1290,Everything was great beaside the table. I called days before our arrival date saying I want to reserve a table in a good spot as it was my husbands birthday. When we arrived there was no table ready for us. We had to walk around with the lady to find a table for ourselves. And found a table that I really didn't like the location. We had to sit there. It wasn't very nice to experience but beside everything was great.,4," October 21, 2016"
1291,"It was good for the experience but now that we have eaten there, I don't see us going to another Brazilian steak house.",4," October 21, 2016"

1293,We always come to FOGO. We love it here! Service cannot be beat and the food is amazing,5," October 20, 2016"
1294,"One of our favourite restaurants! absolutely love this place. All you can eat meat, and the food is absolutely delicious! Bacon wrapped sirloin is my fave and the key lime cheesecake!! Staff is really great!",5," October 17, 2016"
1295,Fantastic experience.  Excellent food and service. Will return again five star <strong></strong>*,5," October 17, 2016"
1296,"We went there for our dad's 70th birthday dinner. We had reservations and were seated promptly upon our arrival. The food was fantastic. The meat servers were wonderful and did not miss a beat to serve us. The drink server, however, did not bring our drinks to us in a timely fashion. So much that we received the bill before our second drinks were served. Had we known we would not have ordered a second round. We should have known as the first round he took the drink order for half the table and then walked away. We called him back to finish the drink order. When he brought the table (table of 8)the drinks he only brought 6 of them and we had to ask a few times before the others were brought to the table. Would I go back there, absolutely.",4," October 15, 2016"
1297,"Amazing food, staff and ambience! Great location amazing experience!",5," October 15, 2016"
1298,"If you like to eat dead animals, this is your spot. The Meats are all great cuts, cooked fantastically, brought to your table. The best part is the variety; Gauchos walk around with various meats cooked various ways and you can try a little of this and a little of that and everything is offered at all cook lengths (rare, medium rare, medium ,medium well etc.). <br/><br/>The food bar/salad bar has a lot of options. I went for the meat so the only thing that we got from the salad bar was smoked salmon, some sun dried tomatoes and some cheeses (to eat with the meat). <br/><br/>It's on the pricier side, but for Boston it's not even that badly priced (prices here are ridiculous).  for about $50 each, you'll be stuffed to the brim and will have fully enjoyed yourself up to that point.",5," October 15, 2016"
1299,"We informed that we are celebrating a birthday. They brought cake/ice cream with a lit candle and a HappyBirthday garnish after we were done with the food and drinks. Our server checked on us regularly. The meat servers showed up very quickly and regularly as well. The restaurant is pretty spacious and great for big family get-togethers. It is a full bar. The meat was a little over-seasoned, but overall pretty tasty.",5," October 14, 2016"

1305,Had a great time here on our honeymoon the servers surprised us with a desert that said happy honeymoon!!!,5," October 9, 2016"
1306,Authentic meat fest.  Service was fantastic . The Round table we were sat at made this business dinner meeting perfect for 9 of us. There were times when the delivery of meat was delayed and times when there was too much delivery.,5," October 8, 2016"
1307,"The cheeses were great, and the meats were phenomenal. The Cauliflower Sirloin was amazing.",5," October 8, 2016"
1308,This restaurant never ceases to amaze me.  The food is so tasty.  It will definitely fill you up.. come hungry!,5," October 8, 2016"
1309,"Meats weren't very flavorful and were too salty. Mashed potatoes tasted fake. Way too pricey for ""lunch"" and definitely NOT a date pace due to the constant interruptions. Will stick to a traditional steak house next time.",1," October 8, 2016"
1310,This was my first time at Fogo de Chao. Went for my friends birthday and had a wonderful time. Food was great and service was amazing. Looking forward to my next visit!,5," October 7, 2016"
1311,"Was surprised about the lack of customer service, in a setting where your staff is the focal point along with the food, of course.  Our initial waiter was informative and courteous but that was the last we saw of him. A number of other staff people descended upon our table at various times, the serving staff was exceptional and the highlight of the night.  Waited for coffee and dessert for over 20 mins...and another 20 minutes for the bill.  Would say that they either need re-training or bring on additional help.",3," October 7, 2016"
1312,"The last time I had eaten in a restaurant such as this I was in Brazil. Fogo de Chao's food was fun and good. The salad bar had several typically Brazilian items. The meats were cooked perfectly. The wait staff was helpful, friendly, and made dining a real pleasure.",5," October 3, 2016"
1313,Sunday brunch with sister from out of town.  Nothing so fine as a Churrasco chat.,4," October 2, 2016"
1314,I loved the ambiance and the waiters were very friendly. The food was delicious and fulfilling. Only issue was my family and I were sitting next to the door which made us cold. Besides that it was a nice night out celebrating my sisters birthday! :),5," October 1, 2016"
1315,"We love this place we come once or twice a year for birthdays. Normally the service is great but  the main waiter seemed overwhelmed from the time we sat down till the time we left. their was also a large party of at least 20-30 people preparing to sit next to us and I felt that we were forgotten a little bit in the process only being a table of 5. The food was good but we were in the corner and a lot of the options did not make it to us. But I must say one of the waitresses came over and we asked( after we asked our waiter) for lamb chops, this is one of my boyfriends favorite items , as we had not seen them at all and she made sure that they came to the table and even followed up when they did not arrive right away. Overall still a happy meal as the food as always made up for the slow service.",3," October 1, 2016"
1316,Over priced. Bad service. Champagne glass cut my lip from a chip in it and they didn't even take off the bill. Drink prices tooo high,4," September 30, 2016"
1317,We came here for my birthday and I've been wanting to try it for awhile after driving by it so many times and I've heard good things. The server was nice and the people brought the cuts of meat over very quickly. I never had to wait very long. There were so many sides that I don't think I even got to try them all. I was super stuffed when I left. All the meats were cooked perfectly and were well seasoned. I would definitely come back.,4," September 30, 2016"
1318,"This was my second visit. I was completely impressed the first time by the variety in the salad bar, the attentive service and meat variety and service.  This time however,  the service was less attentive, the meat was seasoned excessively with SALT it was almost inedible. Did the chef roll a thick layer of salt on the meat? Not necessary. The variety of meat was very limited compared to our first visit. The staff kept coming to our table with the same choices. We eventually asked where the filet mignon, lamb, etc was.  We also saw a very interesting cut of meat being searched on an attractive board but that was never offered. A little disappointing the second time around.",3," September 25, 2016"
1319,"Sevice not good as other units.   Unhappy and unpolite waiter Foodbar used to be better.<br/>parking fee U$ 20,00",3," September 24, 2016"
1320,The food was just not that good. All the meat was over-flavored and usually too salty. The mashed potatoes hardened within 10 minutes. The only OK part of the food was the salad bar.,3," September 24, 2016"
1321,"The food was excellent and everyone enjoyed everything they ate.  Compared to other locations my family and I have visited, the service in Boston falls short to the service in Pennsylvania, Indianapolis, and Baltimore, but the food quality remains the same.",4," September 24, 2016"
1322,Great food and impeccable service. The waiters  are attentive and funny. Great place for large groups. Food is fresh and delicious. Meat was a little salty but tender and succulent.,5," September 24, 2016"
1323,"Most meats are oversalted. Not as many hot dishes (other than meats) as other Brazilian steakhouses I have visited. Also disappointed in the lack of filet. In more than an hour, only one server came by with a single leftover piece (lukewarm) and not enough for my table. We tried to find another server with filet, but perhaps they didn't make it to our dining area. Overall, an expensive disappointment. I really wanted to like this place, but alas...",3," September 24, 2016"
1324,Great food and service - being able to eat a lot of types of cuts/meats was great,5," September 23, 2016"
1325,"We had a great time! It was my daughters 21st Birthday. I mentioned it in the reservation and they brought out a dessert with happy birthday written on the plate! The service was flawless, never wanting for anything. Even our water glasses stayed full. The manager stopped by our table to ensure we were enjoying our selfs. The food/ meats were amazing. I absolutely plan on going back. Also great option for gluten free dinning.",5," September 23, 2016"
1326,Too expensive for such a very bad food!<br/>Steaks were really salty and didnt taste fresh! Taste like they never clean the grill<br/>Carpirinha were very good tho!,1," September 19, 2016"
1327,visitors and guests always have a fantastic experience and for some Fogo has become their favorite.,5," September 19, 2016"
1328,"My hesitation about the restaurant is that if you are unaware of the way it works (we were unaware), you will be surprised by the price.  We assumed it was a regular ""order what you want off the menu,"" but instead it's a huge buffet of really nice salads and some vegs and then these ""gauchos"" walk around with these different cuts of meat.  And it's expensive.  We would not have been bothered by this if we knew the premise, but it was a surprise that we weren't thrilled about.  Our servers were lovely and the restaurant is as well.",3," September 18, 2016"
1329,"Fogo de Chao has amazing food and it is all you can eat, but I could not eat there all the time. I prefer to go there for special occasions, as the meal can get expensive, especially with drinks. Their wine list is thorough and they have amazing desserts, but I never have them because I am so stuffed from the great Brazilian food.<br/><br/>This place is for meat lovers only. Although they have a great salad bar, if you are a vegetarian, I would go elsewhere.",5," September 17, 2016"
1330,"Good food at Fogo de Chao! It was my birthday and first time visiting. There is a buffet and also several meat cutters with various meats that will cut to order. I had fantastic lamb, pork tenderloin parmesan, ribs, and sirloin. All were done nicely.",5," September 17, 2016"
1331,This is with out a doubt the best dinner I have had for a long time :).  <br/>I just can't wait to return someday.<br/><br/>Best regards<br/>Birgir,5," September 16, 2016"
1332,"This restaurant does best with the larger pieces of meat that you can request the way you like it - medium-rare, rare, etc.  The smaller pieces of meat seemed to be all overcooked - the lamb chops where well done - but, it was seasoned well, so it wasn't horrible.  Other small pieces of meat that they just take off without slicing seemed to be overcooked as well (I prefer my meat medium-rare).  Also, I don't know how they decide what tables to come to - there were times some selections of meat never came to our table, and one time the server did come, gave two of us slices, then took off running in the other direction, leaving my friend (who had her card turned to green) with nothing.  She tried calling him, but he took off too fast.  The food was mostly good and the buffet was good too.  But, I just came back from Germany where I ate at a Brazilian steak house, and they did everything perfect, so this one didn't live up to my expectations.",4," September 16, 2016"
1333,"this is not a place for anybody who knows the difference between Prime beef and choice or select, had to try it out, I loved the Salad Bar and the service was really good, but the Quality of the beef was really really bad, less than Choice, my guess is select. because the quality of the beef is so low you must have it cooked at least medium, and I like my beef rare, tried a few of the cuts rare and it was like shoe leather with little or no marbling, only two cuts were passable, the ribeye and the short rib roast, the rest ended up in a pile on a plate. for the quality, the price should be half of what  it is. if you don't know better you will love the place.",2," September 16, 2016"
1334,"Excellent dinner.  Everything cooked perfectly, servers attentive to requests for medium rare, well done etc.  the food at Fogo is consistently excellent.  Great service as well.",5," September 16, 2016"

1337,"We went with another couple for my wife's birthday.  It was a great experience, though it took more than 10 min to be approached by a wait staff member after being seated.  Drink refills were slower than desired, but the food was outstanding, and one of the waiters overheard it was my wife's birthday and brought out a desert with a candle for free.  They didn't make a big scene which was perfect and appreciated.  We will definitely go back when Brazilian BBQ is desired.",5," September 10, 2016"
1338,Fun place to eat,3," September 10, 2016"

From the wines, cocktails,   fresh market table (buffet), meats, &amp; sides, to coffees, desserts, after-dinner drinks, we   have no complaints.  We especially enjoyed the lamb chops,  house special sirloin,  key lime pie and Irish coffee.",5," September 4, 2016"
1343,"My 15 year-old son and his friend certainly enjoyed and got their money's worth!  They loved being able to select the meats to be carved off for them at the table. The salad bar was fresh &amp; has a very impressive range of items but as it's a set price menu,  you really have to go with a hearty appetite to feel you have had good value for money!",4," September 3, 2016"

1346,Excellent food and salad bar to die for!  Great atmosphere and experience...totally worth it!,5," September 1, 2016"
1347,"Had a great mid-week dinner.  Suggest you avoid dining on weekends.  The servers are more attentive during the week, and the food seems better prepared.",4," August 31, 2016"
1348,"I've been to this location a number of times over the years, and we always have a great experience.  However, at our last visit, there were several problems with the food and service.  The cuts of meat, which usually produce moans of delight around the table, tasted unseasoned and uninspired.  Also, the gauchos often chose meat that did not match my request.  I always say, ""medium rare,"" but some of my cuts were deep red in the middle while others were cooked through.  I would have respected the gaucho saying, ""I do not have medium rare right now, but I will be back with some shortly,"" rather than just cutting off a slice of whatever.  Finally, our waiter was very slow to refill our waters and ask if we wanted a second cocktail.  By the time the meal had ended, we just asked for the check instead of selecting a dessert or ice wine, as we often do.  It was a disappointing experience, especially for $165 (for two people).",3," August 28, 2016"
1349,"Our service was dysmal. Drinks were forgotten and never delivered. We always got the same meats ""leg of lamb"" 5 times and NO Garlic beef or filet mignon.",1," August 27, 2016"
1350,First time patrons to celebrate my husband's 50th.  Loved everything.  The food was fabulous and the water was awesome. I will definitely go back.,4," August 27, 2016"

1352,"We love it here, but the drink prices are outrageous.  I got a drink that was mostly ice and it was $16.  I find that to be way overpriced.  I wouldn't have had AS much of an issue paying $12, but $16 for what it was?  That is ridiculous - it was worth MAYBE $10.  However, the food was excellent and the ambiance was beautiful.",5," August 27, 2016"
1353,Their fire-roasted meats were cooked to perfection. The only complaint is it was slightly too salty for our liking. The pao de queijo is to die for and I would come back just for those.,5," August 26, 2016"
1354,"Everything was great! Staff were on top of everything. Always available, and would ask how everything was going. The manager (tall woman) was super kind and was always around. Overall, my husbands and I had a wonderful date night, and the staff at fogo de ch√£o made it special. Thank you so much you guys! Keep it up!!!",5," August 26, 2016"
1355,"Come hungry because you will leave incredibly full! Fast, polite and attentive service. The most delicious meats I've ever had. We took our time and ate slowly, never once feeling rushed by the staff. Delicious key lime pie for dessert, if you save room!",5," August 26, 2016"
1356,This was my first time eating here. The food was amazing!!! The homemade lemonade was fantastic as well,5," August 26, 2016"
1357,"Went rest week, limited menu and no prime cuts.  Not a good value.",3," August 26, 2016"
1358,"The only drawbacks to this as a Brazilian restaurant was the lack of some common foods/drinks that you would always see at a barbecue in Brazil such as jello with sweetened condensed milk, Brazilian strawberry moose, Maracuja, and some other side dishes.  The deserts were more along the lines of New York style cheesecake and key lime pie; rather American.  The rest of the food, however, was more than enough of a departure from standard American fare to prove it was something new and exciting while still maintaining a pleasing set of flavors and textures to most palates.",5," August 26, 2016"
1359,"Good quality beef, but the price is totally out of this world. Definitely not worth it.",3," August 25, 2016"
1360,"To start: the food was absolutely delicious! The meat was cooked to anyone's needs. The waiter even brought over a specially cooked meat for one of my fellow patrons. Once you turn over the green card, there is an abundance of protein on your plate. The noise level was moderate-loud but not overbearing. I am excited to eat here again. <br/><br/>As a side note, make sure you do not 'stuff' yourself on the bread and salad, it is a tad tempting",5," August 24, 2016"
1361,"Pricey for the cuts of meats offered.  I had to request the filet mignon at least 7 times before the meat was offered.  Seems like all other types of pork, chicken and lower quality of meats are plentiful.  You need to be patient when waiting for higher qualities as well as for paying the bill.  Restaurant wasn't that busy but the wait to check out was at least 25 - 30 minutes long.",3," August 24, 2016"
1362,Food was good with lots of choices and fresh.  Staff was professional and very helpful and able to offer suggestions.,4," August 24, 2016"
1363,Great environment and great meat. Had a blast with friends for a birthday,5," August 23, 2016"
1364,The food was very good.  The only thing we were not impressed with was the pork ribs.  All other meat was excellent -- stand out is the top round.   <br/><br/>The cheese popovers were delicious.    The market table offered something for everyone.  It was jammed on a Monday night but they were not trying to rush anyone to free up a table.,5," August 22, 2016"
1365,Awesome cheese bread and salad bar was great! The meat just kept coming. Went for restaurant week so only 7 meats were searched but it was still plenty. Would definitely return to try all the meats. Servers and manager were all friendly and welcoming.  Definitely a recommend to try at least once.,5," August 21, 2016"
1366,Amazing as always!,5," August 21, 2016"
1367,This is our favorite steakhouse in Boston! Love love love the meats.,5," August 21, 2016"
1368,Food was great. Some of the servers were extremely helpful as others were just OK. I wish there were some different options as far as sides on the buffet table.,5," August 21, 2016"
1369,Service is always excellent. Staff could not be more attentive! And food is absolutely awesome!!!,5," August 21, 2016"
1370,"If you like meat, this place delivers every time.  Where else can you get unlimited, 10 types of off the skewer meats delivered and cut right in front of you to your liking?  A bit pricey but worth it!",5," August 20, 2016"
1371,"Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse is a must-go restaurant for meat lover. Also, there are salad and fruit bar for refreshing your tongue. Highly recommended.",4," August 19, 2016"
1372,"We had dinner at Fogo de Chao  during the Boston Dine Out week and we really enjoyed the food. The buffet (market table) was really good and the picanha was amazing! I also enjoyed the Key Lime Pie. Overall is a really good place even though is a bit expensive if, like in my case, you don't eat a lot",4," August 19, 2016"
1373,"I've been to several Brazilian Churrascarias (steakhouses) in my life, including several in Brazil and this was right up there with some of the best.  The fact that it was Restaurant Week and they offered a reduced price (with a few of the more expensive cuts of steak omitted) was a great value but even at full price this is a terrific experience.  If you've never done the brazilian steakhouse thing, this is one of those places where they come around with long rotisserie skewer after skewer of select cuts of steak, pork and chicken and slice off whatever you'd like (e.g. medium rare ).  Diners have a chip that they turn to green (serve me) or red (I'm taking a break).  They also provide side dishes for the table and you have access to an unbelievable full salad and seafood bar.  So, the moral of the story is arrive hungry because there is SO much incredbile delicious food that you don't want to under-do it.  You will leave uncomfortably full, no matter what.  <br/><br/>The desserts were great too, by the way.  Just big enough but not giant.",5," August 19, 2016"
1374,"Most amazing dining experience that I've had in Boston the last 5 years. Service is fast and friendly, food selection is extensive and well sourced, atmosphere and setup is efficient and organized. I would most certainly recommend to anyone interested in a fine buffet dining experience.",5," August 19, 2016"
1375,Great food as always!! The service is great too. The bread and meat selection is amazing!,5," August 19, 2016"
1376,The food is very good nice service but the Caipirinha price is very high.,4," August 19, 2016"
1377,We loved the market table and the sides that were brought to our table. It was nice to be able to choose from the types of meat being offered by the strolling servers with their skewers. The dessert was great too.,5," August 18, 2016"
1378,Excepcional Service! I love The food and salad bar.  I would vigila recommend this restaurant to my family and friends.,5," August 17, 2016"
1379,I've been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. It's a little pricey but well worth it.,5," August 17, 2016"

1381,Love the different meats and the bread. Yummm,5," August 16, 2016"
1382,"My daughter and I went here for restaurant week. The salad bar is amazing with an array of fresh salads, meat, cheese, toppings and vegetables. The salad bar alone would be great by itself. It is too easy to fill up on the delicious side dishes. After we went to the salad bra we were given polenta, cooked bananas and cheese rolls (that are sooo delicious). The meat then stared arriving: several variations of beef, pork ,chicken and lamb. There are little coasters on the table that are turned to red to indicate that you need a break from all the food and then turn to green to ""fill up"".We had a choice of several cakes for dessert. The food was very good and plentiful. We were both so full after we ate. We would go back but only after fasting for week!!",5," August 16, 2016"
1383,"I found a lot of the food at the market bar wasn't very good - a lot of the vegetables had been roasted then chilled and they lost both texture and flavor that way. The soup was excellent, but I didn't care for much else. The cheesy bread was incredible, the roasted bananas tasty but mushy, the mashed potatoes decent, but the polenta fries had no flavor. I would have liked the option to have chicken without the bacon wrapping and most of the steak/lamb offerings were too underdone for my taste even though the servers tried to give me fairly well done pieces. The fattiness of the meat was also unpredictable. The top sirloin was the best option when it was lean and cooked through, but I had some pieces that were inedible. The dessert was tasty but tiny. The service was generally good, but a lot of the servers bypassed my table even when the ""please stop"" sign was showing. Water refills were plentiful, though, and they accommodated my request for a table in a specific location. Overall I enjoyed my meal, but even visiting during Restaurant Week when the food was less expensive I felt it overpriced for what I was willing to eat. I might go again at lunchtime or as a treat during a future Restaurant Week event, but I would not pay full price for dinner there. I would only recommend it for people who like all of the meats they offer, prefer their meat on the reddish side, and who are looking for a special meal in the Copley Square area.",2," August 16, 2016"

1385,"My group really enjoyed (in the beginning) the constant service of meats, but after a while, we were looking for the servers they disappeared, and there was slight disappointment amongst my eight guest.  Overall, it was a great dining experience.  I would go again.",4," August 14, 2016"
1386,"Fogo is a great place to dine if you like meat. I think it has one of the best salad bars ever. So really everyone should find something they like to eat. One warning - no matter how careful you are, you will overeat! We usually dine at the Minneapolis Fogo and the service in Minneapolis is outstanding (kudos to manager Matt &amp; his staff). Here in Boston it wasn't at the same level. We were brought the side dishes before my husband was finished his salad. It then took a long time before his salad dish was removed and a new plate delivered. By that time the side dishes were cold. I think our server realized we weren't impressed because she started to try a bit harder. I notice in Minneapolis all servers help each other.",4," August 14, 2016"
1387,I've been here before and the experience was amazing! I'm not sure if I'll be pressed to come back though. My waitress was ok but there was another woman there that was super amazing and helpful. My glass was dirty and she mad sure to fix the issue immediately. I can say the LAMB CHOPS are amazing.,3," August 14, 2016"
1388,"Food was excellent, and service during meal was fine. However, we had to wait in a long line just to check in despite having a reservation. Upon check-in, they gave us a buzzer, which would vibrate when our table is ready. Waited another 20 minutes or so. I did not experience this long wait in the last couple of times I was at Fogo. I understand that it gets crowded during peak times, but that is exactly why I made a reservation in advance. When I made a reservation at OpenTable, all the dinner times were marked as available. Maybe they overbook too much.",5," August 13, 2016"
1389,We never received our side dishes the whole meal. Staff seemed overwhelmed at the crowds.,3," August 13, 2016"
1390,Always on point and great food and service!,5," August 13, 2016"
1391,"Cold food bar was great with great selection! Sides were amazing, the bananas... I could have eatten them only and be happy!! Meats however for the most part were not tender at all! I expected more flavor and a lot more tenderness... I do not like getting steak on my plate and wishing I had A1 or something with flavor! Staff was amazing and friendly, and they brought me and my mom out a birthday flan when they learned we were celebrating our birthdays! Ps the flan was AMAZING!!",4," August 13, 2016"
1392,"Everything was very good!!  The food was very goo, the salad at excent. The waitress was very good.",5," August 12, 2016"
1393,Amazing food and more meat than anyone could ever consume. You flip over your coaster from red to green and you are practically inundated by a carnivore's dream.,5," August 12, 2016"
1394,Everything met my expectations<br/>Meal was delicious!,5," August 11, 2016"
1395,"Great food, but they did not have fairly common wines in stock (2 out of our 4 choices they did not have from their wine list).  The recommended substitute wines were nothing like the original choices...perhaps they should hire a wine steward!",4," August 11, 2016"
1396,Delicious array of meats and all you can eat,4," August 8, 2016"
1397,"Terrible overall. Mediocre service, low quality meats,  excellent salad bar.  This chains time has come and gone.  Way overpriced food and wine.",1," August 8, 2016"
1398,"It's not cheap! But if you want semiformal Brazilian BBQ, this is your only bet in the Boston area.<br/><br/>The only thing that justifies the price was the fact that you're getting hot all-you-can-eat meat in an upscale setting. Everthing was reasonably tasty, but the non-meat options were merely ""good"" rather than ""masterful"", which is less than I'd expect for the price of admission.<br/><br/>We were there about 2 hours, during which time we were not offered anything more exotic than lamb chops or bacon-wrapped steak. They had beef, pork, lamb, chicken. We were not offered any organ meats or offal (heart, liver, tongue, etc). Depending on your taste, the selection may be a bonus or a disappointment.",4," August 8, 2016"
1399,"If you like Brazilian churrasco, this is the place to go.  Genuine experience, great food.",1," August 7, 2016"
1400,"I have eaten at several Brazilian steakhouses throughout the country as well as several in Brazil. All the restaurants we have eaten at before served authentic Brazilian side dishes. This restaurant served American sides and the ""Brazilian"" mainstay of rice was cooked dry and tasteless. It is an embarrassment to Brazilian cuisine. Perhaps you are able to fool American patrons, but anyone who has ever eaten true Brazilian steakhouse cuisine will leave this restaurant sorely disappointed. Even more sad, half the meat cutters did not know how to properly cut the meat.  To top everything off, although we were asked how we wanted our meat cooked, reality was that everything was cooked one way, medium rare to raw... Utterly disappointed I drove 2 hours for such a letdown.",1," August 7, 2016"
1401,"I was disappointed at that many of the traditional Brazilian food was missing from the typical menu. Ans when I asked if there would be a fresh serving coming, I was told ""no."" and no explanation.",3," August 7, 2016"
1402,"I  had been to Fogo for business lunches and enjoyed the ambiance. I decided to share the experience with my wife and so booked this for our anniversary. I assumed it would be a classy ambiance and a romantic night out. It was not!! First off, it was a zoo with young kids running all over the place.  One of them even stole my wife's utensils while we were up at the salad bar. I also would have assumed the dress code would be a bit classier for a restaurant with $50 entree's. Much of the clientele looked like they walked in off the street, unwashed in dirty sandals, shorts and Tshirts. Gross! Definitely would not recommend this restaurant for a date night out!",3," August 6, 2016"
1403,"The service was excellent, the food was top notch as always.  We were celebrating our wedding that day with just our adult children.  The staff was extremely attentive.",5," August 6, 2016"

1405,"Disappointing, particularly for the price.   With a couple of exceptions, most of the meats were under seasoned and lacked much flavor.   The lamb chops and especially the rib eye were excellent.",3," August 4, 2016"
1406,The food was excellent as well as the buffet. Unfortunately the service was very poor with service not knowing who drunk what and mixed up when serving. Also the service was rude when we asked about the meat and making jokes when we missunderstood what was what. NOT appreciated!!!!,4," August 3, 2016"

There was only one type of soup, but it was delicious, and nobody goes to a Brazilian steakhouse for the soup. The Garlic Sirloin served rare is my favorite cut of meat to date.<br/><br/>The valet parking was also cheaper than parking in any of the nearby garages.",5," July 24, 2016"

1420,"Good and service were good.  Perhaps not amazing.    For the price it should be amazing.   One of my kids got his money's worth.  My husband enjoyed the meat but probably didn't quite eat enough.  My other son only eats chicken and there was only one chicken option , which he enjoyed but still    I'm a vegetarian and I knew this wouldn't be vegetarian heaven but anticipated the salad bar with rice and beans.   Only problem the beans had meat in it.   Isn't there already plenty of meat?    A vegetarian option for beans would be an inexpensive nice touch   Overall nice meal but I think there are better places to get Brazilian food",4," July 21, 2016"
1421,Great quality and dependable business meal. It's slightly less expensive for lunch- but there are fewer available meat options.  It's still an embarrassment of riches and very impressive.  The room is nicely appointed and the wait staff is very helpful and gracious.   Surprisingly great for vegetarians with lots of interesting non-meat choices.,4," July 21, 2016"
1422,"I've been to quite a few steakhouses and not one comes close to Fogo de Chao. Fogo de Chao knows how to serve well done meat so that it's still tender, no blood and flavorful. My favorite are the lamb chops because it's hard to find lamb chops on other menus. No need to add sauce(s) or ketchup to the meats.",1," July 20, 2016"
1423,Fun!!!! Delicious. Love the salad bar!! You will leave stuffed!,4," July 19, 2016"
1424,"We have dined here before and thought the salad bar was less varied and interesting than what we remember.  The salad bar was a main feature in the past but it was disappointing this time.  Food was fine but not outstanding as was service.  First round of coffees was luke warm.  Found the ambiance a little too noisy, but acceptable.  Overall, not at all good value considering the price and would not recommend.",3," July 19, 2016"
1425,"Great service. Went for a 30th birthday date with my wife, and the service was great! They took great care of us, and made sure we got to try everything!  They even brought out a special birthday dessert for my wife, without even asking! <br/><br/>The food was amazing, but very filling!  Make sure to come here on an empty stomach if you want to try all the different meats!",5," July 17, 2016"
1426,"Compared to the location in Chicago, I was disappointed in the meat. For me, Brazilian meat is synonymous with wonderful flavor and seasoning, a very distinct taste, which this location did not have. I found the meat rather bland and much to rare for my liking. Since the meat is the star of this type of eatery, I left rather disappointed.",4," July 17, 2016"
1427,"This was one of the best Brazilian steak house restaurants we've been to in a while. The service was great, although it wasn't very busy at the time. I don't know how it would be if the place was full. <br/><br/>The quality of the meats was great other than the chicken wrapped in bacon which was quite dry and the salad bar had decent selection, not as varied as some Brazilian steak houses we've been to but it was good.<br/><br/>I look forward to visiting this restaurant again.",4," July 17, 2016"
1428,"The service and ambience at Fogo were great. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary, and the staff made us feel welcome and special. We also thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary creme brulee for dessert.",4," July 17, 2016"
1429,We celebrated  a family birthday and this is the restaurant our son picked. He adores beef and he was not disappointed. The carnivores in our party had a wonderful time trying the various offerings. The beef was superb and the offerings kept on coming. We enjoyed the various salads and the little cheesy rolls. We wanted to save room for the meat so we didn't try the soup. Watching the various meats proffered from the sword was a lot of fun. We loved it and will be back.,5," July 16, 2016"
1430,A first class experience from the moment you walk in.,5," July 16, 2016"
1431,"Once again, Fogo proved to be impressive!<br/>The quality of the food - both at the Market Place salad bar and the meats served Rodizio-style at our table - were fresh, beautifully presented, and, in the case of the meats, prepared to order.  The attention from the waitstaff was constant without being intrusive.<br/>Fogo continues to justify traveling 45 miles for lunch!",5," July 14, 2016"
1432,"Service was mediocre, going through the motions.  Food was average. Price was high.   No menu - you get the choice of 3 options: the ""salad bar"", the bar with sea bass entre, or bar with the endless meat that is carved at your table.  Cool and novel experience, but only if you're a big eater would it be worthwhile.   And don't be enticed into ordering apps - the endless parade of meats and the ""bar"" is just that, endless... all you can possibly eat.  So for someone who can take advantage of that, this is a place for you.",2," July 13, 2016"
1433,The place is fantastic!  Took my familty there to celebrate my mom's birthday in March (although she passed away in January) went back and took my dad to celebrate his birthday.  We all enjoyed it very much.  Ana who is now manager is the BEST!!!,5," July 9, 2016"
1434,"Service good despite being very busy. Meat was well cooked but sides were cold. Our young son had an unfortunate experience while visiting the restroom. A very drunk man had wandered in off the street and our son was too scared to come out of the stall. Luckily my husband checked on him, removed him from the rest room and told a staff member what was going on. No follow up with us to see if everything was ok.",3," July 4, 2016"

The salad bar was always clean, tidy and over abundant with delicious choices. An excellent dining experience overall. I will be back again.",5," June 30, 2016"
1438,"Exactly the experience you would expect from a Fogo de Chao.  Food was fresh and delicious.  The cheese buns didn't disappoint, the salad bar was varied and fantastic, and the meats - oh the meats!  Delicious!<br/><br/>Service was prompt and courteous.",5," June 25, 2016"

1442,"I have been a customer for years, we started with the Atlanta location. Our Father's Day dinner in Boston was incredibly disappointing. The service was terrible. They forgot my drink, did not refill our cheesy bread not one time, and when they partially refilled our appetizers we were already done with dinner. We used to love this place, they would bring our our refills as soon as they disappeared. We had 3 main servers and the only 1 was on point. I hope this was a one-off situation and that this restaurants service isnt falling off.",3," June 19, 2016"
1443,"Fogo is one of our favorite restaurants, but the service tonight was unusually off. The meat either came out all at once or not at all.  The filet was not as good as it usually is.  My husband likes rare, but everything was medium. The servers are very attentive when you bring issues to them, which is nice.",3," June 19, 2016"
1444,"It was fathers day and the service appeared that they were understaffed. Asked for, butter, water , the check . All above had us waiting @ 15 min.

1447,"Definitely the go-to spot for meat lovers! You have to starve yourself for days in preparation for this endless feast. The parade of well seasoned and grilled meats of every variety never stops. And for those who are not big meat eaters, one can opt for the Market Place only meal for ~$25, which includes a delicious soup, rice and beans, as well as a huge variety of cheeses, cold meats, and salads, including my favorite - the Brazilian potato salad!",5," June 18, 2016"
1448,"While the food offerings were very good, I was disappointed that all the possible meat choices were not readily available by the waiters walking around with the meats.  For example, they walked around with certain cuts of meats, and for others, you had to specifically request it.  We asked our waiter for a list of the meat offerings but it never came.  <br/><br/>If I recommend Fogo to my friends I would tell them to ask for the meats they want instead of waiting in the hopes that the waiters will bring it around.",4," June 18, 2016"

It was really fun to see the servers carrying around huge skewers of meat and carve it in front of you.

Added more ribeye to the grill just for our group and would have done more had we requested it.  Customer focus was top focus.  Only regret was we didn't save room for dessert. ;-)<br/>Thanks guys",5," June 7, 2016"
1466,So you get a ton of  meat for $40 for lunch and $50 for dinner. It is cool that they come around and cut it in front of you but not for that price. You have a salad bar which requires no service. Then there are overpriced cocktails...$15. This was my daughter's choice for her birthday.  I would have paid less or the same at the Capital Grille or another well known steak house but we would have had service.,2," June 7, 2016"

My husband is from Brazil so we were so glad they also served rice and beans upon request (among other delicious items- fried polenta,  plantains with a light caramel sauce, p√§o de queijo).  We also tried two different desserts which were both wonderful.  The service was impeccable throughout.  This is definitely more of a special occasion place for us,  due to cost and location,  but we really look forward to going back.",5," June 5, 2016"
1469,"My boyfriend and I recently dined here on a Saturday evening, it was our first time and we were very excited about it. the experience was wonderful. The waitress warmly welcomed us and asked if we had dined there previously. She briefly explained to us where the marketplace was, and how to let them know when we are ready for more meat to eat! The service was amazing, our glasses were always full. They also had an extensive wine selection. Don't leave with out trying the turtle cheesecake!",5," June 4, 2016"
1470,I took my husband for his birthday....he has never been there and he is the biggest meat lover there is....he loved the place and the food and the service....would definitely be going back!,5," June 4, 2016"
1471,"Food was great and everything was high quality from the salad bar and meats to the sides that they bring along. Although certain meats such as the chicken breast and lamb chops were dry/overcooked, other items were very good. I had the most tender cut of filet ever and the top sirloin was also very good. The salad and fruits do well to help balance out the richness of the meats. The carmelized bananas, garlic mash, fried polenta, and warm rolls were delicious as well.",4," June 4, 2016"
1472,"It was my first time at Fogo. The food, atmosphere and ambiance were superb. WILL definitetly be back.",5," June 3, 2016"
1473,"Quality of meats left a lot to be desired at this location, they need to upgrade their vendor. Beef cuts were chewy, not tender, chicken was over cooked on the skewers. The taste of the meats was blah, not enough marinating or spicing.",3," June 3, 2016"
1474,"It was a delicious meal. The market table was great and there was a lot of variety. Great service and lots of meat options brought to the table, but it was too expensive for anything other than a special occasion for college-age people.",5," May 31, 2016"
1475,I have been to Fogo many times and the service is exceptional. The staff works well together as a well oiled machine. It may have been because of the holiday and we had an early dinner reservation at 530pm but I think they were understaffed. What I do appreciate is that is saw Jeff the manager on duty at the time jump in and helped serve food as well as checked in on each table to make sure everything was going well. That is always nice to see. Jeff has always taken good care of us whether I brought 15ppl or just 2. <br/><br/>Thank you,5," May 30, 2016"
1476,"I've always enjoyed dinner here but lunch? Not so much. Only three servers  came to our table with meat. The first, the lamb and chicken. It's ridiculous, some server kept on coming to ask if we're okay instead of sending food to our table. I wanted to scream at them. Literally. Will I come back again? No.",2," May 30, 2016"
1477,"I had dinner here my last night in Boston, and it was fantastic.  I can't speak highly enough of the staff, food, and the service.  10/10",5," May 29, 2016"
1478,"Really enjoyed the experience. When placing the reservation I checked off the anniversary box, and when we got to our seats, it was a really cute table for 2 off in a much quieter room out of the main, really noisy room (not sure if it was because I checked the box, but I'd like to think so). It was very intimate and a really great time, I didn't have to yell or sit close to communicate with my date. The waiter was also really really really fun and awesome, he knew exactly what we wanted and made for a really awesome dining experience. I will definitely be going back there again.",5," May 28, 2016"
1479,"We were expecting quantity but were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food as well. The bar of side dishes was fresh and packed with flavorfully seasoned vegetable dishes. hearts of palm, mango with black rice, and a marinated veggies kept the selection interesting and unusual. Meats were well seasoned and needed no sauce to help them out, though I found I could only eat so much beef and pork. Service was incredible and I left feeling well attended to. Would definitely come back for our next special family gathering.",5," May 28, 2016"
1480,Great food!  Service was excellent. They are pricey but worth it for foods,5," May 28, 2016"
1481,"The service was poor.  The server was not very attentive.  The fish took about 30 minutes to be served.    The meat-servers stopped coming to the table before everyone was done eating.The server left the check at the table before the whole party was finished, and before offering dessert.",2," May 28, 2016"
1482,"It's always a great experience on every single visit. Nontheless you will not be disappointed. I took my boyfriend here for the first time and he's extremely particular with what and where he eats, and boy was he satisfied.",5," May 27, 2016"
1483,Great value for the money. Fabulous meat selection and fresh bar.,5," May 27, 2016"
1484,"We went for our anniversary and had a great time. The food was great, the wait staff friendly and it was a fun atmosphere.",5," May 26, 2016"
1485,The only problem I have is when I made my reservation I requested a birthday cake after meal never got it so that was the downfall.,4," May 24, 2016"
1486,"Perfect location and event for college graduation for 2 best friends and their families!  Great food, easy atmosphere, lovely staff!",5," May 23, 2016"
1487,"It warms my heart when I go to a Fogo de Chao outside of Brazil and see that it is keeping up with the Brazilian standards. You guys make sure the meat, the team, the buffet, everything stays as close as possible to the real deal (and manage to make it 99.99% the same!), and stay away from the stereotypes -- boy, was I ever glad not to have someone dancing beside me while I ate! :)",5," May 23, 2016"
1488,"Great food, good service, nice atmosphere, not cheap",5," May 22, 2016"
1489,I really didn't like that the restaurant shows an a la carte menu and then you get there and you are forced to do the buffet.  I would not have gone if I knew that was the style.  Food was ok but not worth the $$.,2," May 22, 2016"
1490,"Great food, great service, my favorite place to go.  Can't go wrong! Pricey, but worth every penny.",5," May 22, 2016"
1491,Amazing always excellent food and service- i appreciate the hard working team members!,5," May 21, 2016"
1492,We enjoyed our visit very much.  We celebrated with friends for a special occasion.  Food was delicious and the wait staff Cheyenne and Tom excellent.,5," May 21, 2016"
1493,"The food from beginning to end was excellent as was the awesome service.  Never a need for anything, someone was always coming around. Can't wait to go back.",5," May 21, 2016"
1494,It was delicious. But they pushed sheep and we had to ask for filet.,4," May 20, 2016"
1495,"Fogo de Chao takes care of all my steakhouse needs. Great food and great service! I enjoy that staff recognize me and know what I like. It feels like home. My primary waiter, Rafael, is fantastic!",5," May 20, 2016"
1496,"We have eaten several time at this place. They have a fantastic buffet which is self service and inexpensive for what is offered. The subsequent meat offering is copious non stop and mostly of excellent quality. There is a choice of various cuts of beef, lamb, chicken and pork. They have roasted bananas and polenta as sides.",5," May 19, 2016"
1497,"Very simple menu, its meat meat and more meat.  Which was awesome.  If you like meat.  There is a ""common table"" which is buffet style cheeses and salads.  Then you flip your coster from Red to Green and the circulating meats start arriving.  The lamb was excellent and perfectly seasoned.  If you like your meats really rare it can be difficult to get the cut you like.  All of the meats were juicy irrespective of the amount of doneness.",5," May 17, 2016"
1498,"Great service, great cheesy bread, great meat, chessy bread, good wine selection, did I mention the chessy bread?",4," May 15, 2016"
1499,"Food was great, staff was great too, very accommodating to any special needs we had. Only quibble is that the room temperature was very cold, we had to keep our jackets on for the entire meal.",4," May 15, 2016"
1500,"Amazing experience for mine and my boyfriend's two year anniversary! The staff was extremely nice, the food was fantastic, and the day was perfect.",5," May 15, 2016"
1501,"My family and I chose Fogo de Chao to celebrate my youngest sibling's accomplishment on graduating college! The atmosphere was warm and friendly and the service was outstanding. All staff members were helpful in ensuring that we had an enjoyable evening. From the choices in meat and cuts to the very fresh salad bar, the food was delicious! Well worth the price! My dad and I did find the cocktails to be quite pricey, but good thing we came to eat!",5," May 14, 2016"
1502,"I am not a steak person, but the steak was incredible.  It was cooked however you preferred your steak to be cooked and many different cuts of meat with one being just as delicious as the first.  They also have a salad bar that has everything you could think to put on a salad and more.",4," May 14, 2016"
1503,Great food and plenty of it.... Service was good too !,5," May 14, 2016"
1504,Our experience was excellent! Our waiter Rafael was definitely a 5 star! <br/>Awesome time!,5," May 14, 2016"
1505,"Great meat and an amazing selection. Great market table with fresh salads, bread and soups. We will definitely be back.",5," May 13, 2016"
1506,"This is a Brazilian churrascuria,  pretty authentic.  There is a lot of food, with a salad buffet to start and many many different kinds of meat that are brought to your table.  Don't go if you are not hungry.  Also, there seem to be a lot of groups (tourists?  Work groups?) which isn't really to our liking.  They come in and mob the buffet making it difficult for groups of two or three.  A little frantic.  The food, particularly the beef, is very good.",4," May 12, 2016"
1507,Salad bar  with extensive choices; grilled meats excellent;  wine list is way overpriced.  Desserts overpriced. Overall fine dining experience.,4," May 11, 2016"
1508,The overall experience was great. Only one server was extremely rude and unfriendly but everyone else was very friendly. May be he was having a bad day but the experience would have been better if this server was not so rude. We tried to ignore it and still have a good time.,3," May 9, 2016"
1509,"We were at the restaurant on a Monday Night around 6h00 PM, maybe not quite busy yet and not much turnaround of meat. A lot of overcooked meat despite we asked for rare or medium rare for beef or lamb.<br/><br/>Salad buffet is great. Wine list is unique.",3," May 9, 2016"
1510,"This is an all you can eat, Brazilian Steak House. They start you with an amazing salad bar with many vegetables and such. Ten the meat begins. They just keep coming around with meat until you put up your little card for them to stop. The amount of food is astounding. Great place to bring hungry people. While not inexpensive, you can eat and eat until you explode. The food was tasty. They also bring you side dishes of sauteed bananas  and a couple of other things, but I don't remember what they where. Do not let them sell you ala' carte appetizers of pay extra for desert. You will have so much food, you will not need it! and you can get extra bananas for dessert. This was a fun experience to do once.. We could have eaten at a really good restaurant, by the time we paid for a few drinks and dinner. We wouldn't have had as much food, but nobody needs that much. It appears to be a special occasion restaurant for people that don't normally eat at fancy restaurants.  Think a couple of steps above an Olive Garden. Lots of people think that's great. I am just not one of those people.",3," May 8, 2016"
1511,The service is as good as the food. Our server - Cheyenne - was super. The food was delicious. It doesn't get better,5," May 8, 2016"
1512,"Just OK.  Bar is very pleasant but small.  Decor is very good, but the food is merely ok.  The buffet is of high quality, but the meats served by the Gauchos is of uneven quality (not well marbled, tough).  In addition, there is a sameness in flavor as there are no sauces -- no chimichurri! -- and only basic cuts of meat.  For example, no chicken hearts, a rodizio staple.<br/><br/>Service, other than the Gauchos, was slow and not attentive. When waiter was there, he was pushing for extra cost foods like the shrimp cocktail or more drinks.  <br/><br/>Good spot for a meat loving group get together/co-workers event.",3," May 2, 2016"
1513,"Knowing Chimaz the Brazilian steakhouse in Charlotte and Fort Lauderdale, I wanted to try something else. Unfortunately the first impression was more like - wow that restaurant is super busy and crowded. Food was ok but I am used to better one from Chimaz. Overall ok but not my favorite for the money.",3," April 30, 2016"
1514,"This was a great restaurant for a group. We celebrated a 40th birthday with a group of guys friends. Be careful not to fill up on the salad bar, although it's hard not to. The meat is delicious.",4," April 30, 2016"
1515,"A meat-lover's paradise. Pretty much every piece of meat I had was simply perfect.  Go hungry as you'll want to try as many things as you can (and the price isn't cheap, so you'll also want to get your money's worth).",4," April 30, 2016"
1516,We had my husband's 30th birthday here with a group of 12 people varying in ages from 14 - 60. Everyone seemed to really like the dinner. Keep in mind the drinks are pretty steep (although not surprising for Boston) and if they recommend the shrimp cocktail appetizer (or any appetizer for that matter) it does NOT come with the meal price! We thought it did and were extremely surprised to see $80 ($20/serving - 6 shrimp) worth of shrimp cocktail at the end! Overall food was great. <br/><br/>Suggestions: Skip the appetizer - there is plenty of food! Don't fill up at the market bar - maybe a small salad and then go for the meat and the sides they bring.,5," April 30, 2016"
1517,I was surprised to see that turner fisheries was turned into a Brazilian BBQ restaurant. However it was quite nice. Take your family there but make sure you skip a few meals beforehand so you can get your $52.00 worth. In my humble opinion of it were $10.00 cheaper I would probably have more plans of going back. Good ok but expensive for this.,4," April 29, 2016"
1518,The food was good. The salad bar was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,5," April 29, 2016"
1519,"The first thing that I would suggest is use the valet parking it's only $20 but you pull-up and you call them 10 minutes  before you are ready to leave and your car is right there when you need it. In reading reviews I was lucky enough to pick up the tip of asking if there was anything that needed to be asked for versus being served and they had told us you need to ask for the beef ribs we did in oh my goodness they were delicious and huge.  The servers were phenomenal one had noticed that my wife's card was green but she was passing on certain items he then asked her if there was something in particular she was looking for she answered, and within minutes he came out with a brand-new skewer of just that product now that is service.  I would suggest 6 o'clock or later sometimes early seatings result in slower service .  The last thing I would suggest is to turn your card to red so that you have time to enjoy your meets while they are still warm I started by just leaving my card green and meat was piling up by the time I got to cutting some of my meats they were a bit cold but that was my fault.  We can't afford to eat there every month but it's worth passing up going out to eat as often as we do in order to eat fantastic meals like the one we enjoyed here.",5," April 28, 2016"
1520,"Once again, Fogo de Chao did not disappoint.  The cheese rolls were served hot and were great.  The Caipirinha's were delicious with two first-time diners in our group of 6 becoming fans.  The salad bar (Market Table) was it's usual fantastic assortment: cheeses, smoked salmon, prosciutto, salami, hearts of palm, asparagus, artichokes, endives, etc.  Of course, the meat selections: Picanha, Alcatra, Fraldina, beef ribs, pork ribs, pork and pork sausage, rib lamb chops, chicken, were all prepared as requested and served without having to ask.  Refills of cheese rolls, drinks and candied bananas were automatic. <br/>Everyone flt the food, service, and ambience were outstanding and the promotional luncheon price of $36.95 cannot be beaten.  It can't even be equaled!<br/>I can't wait until we return.",5," April 27, 2016"
1521,"With 7 visits under my belt, I'm pleased to say I've never been disappointed with Fogo de Chao. The food and service is delightful.",5," April 27, 2016"
1522,"5 out of 5 across the board -- but it's pretty loud crowd.  Great food and fun -- but not necessarily a quiet, romantic spot for 2.  More appropriate to groups of 3 or more.",5," April 26, 2016"
1523,"it was a good experience, but it took the waiters a while to come to the table with different types of meat. I didn't get the chance to try lamb that night, which was a disappointment for me.",4," April 23, 2016"
1524,"I have been to this restaurant a few times now and in the past have been quite pleased.  However, this past visit leaves me less than enthusiastic.  The service was poor, the restaurant unusually loud and unwelcoming.  The ""salad bar"" was missing several items and was not restocked in an efficient manner.  I had to ask a server for the standard sides which are typically served table side.   After talking with the manager, hopefully things will improve.  Maybe it was just a bad night... we will see.",3," April 23, 2016"
1525,"Great food and service but definitely pricey. We went for dinner so it was pretty expensive. But lunch is cheaper, so my friends and I will try the lunch next time!",5," April 22, 2016"
1526,"First time visit at the Boston location. Highly recommend the Chicago restaurant, which seems to have a better quality and taste of meat and more elegant salad bar.",4," April 22, 2016"
1527,"This restaurant is your typical ""Gaucho Rodizio"" style Brazilian restaurant. The difference between Fogo and the others is that the quality and selection of the meat options are much better. A more pricier option for a restaurant but you do get your value for what you pay.<br/><br/>Personal Recommendation: Come hungry (especially for dinner) and DO NOT go to the salad/side dish bar. As much as you can resist, this restaurant is all about the meats not the salad and other Brazilian side dishes. If you must, get a just a little. You're not coming to this restaurant for a huge salad and a little steak. For the price you're paying, stick to the main course.<br/><br/>One last tidbit: When you get there, ask your server to get you the 'Beef Ribs'. Its not a meat that's on the rotation (you must ask for it) and is included in your price. Basically, your server will come out with a good size cutting board with a huge bone in Rib. Very tender and tasty - a bit salty as is the case with most of their meats.",4," April 21, 2016"
1528,Exceptional detail with allergies!  We have 2 celiacs and a nut allergy in our group.  Not a problem.  Everything you could have was on an allergy menu they gave us so we knew exactly what was safe without asking a thousand questions.  The servers must all split the tips because they work together in harmony and with exceptional detail.  The food is so fresh with all the cuts of meat coming around to us twice.  What a bargain for what you are served.  I spent more money at McCormick and S. with much less in quality and service.  Recommend this to anyone!,5," April 19, 2016"
1529,"We could not have been more disappointed.  We have been to several other Brazilian Steakhouses and have always been very impressed, so we chose this restaurant to celebrate my husband completing the Boston Marathon. The tab was almost $300 for 4 adults, including one glass of wine and one cocktail. The meat was always overdone and tough and tasteless. We finally asked the manager if we could get some meat cooked medium-rare and finally got a few slices of meat that were good, but for a $300 meal, we expected the meat to be cooked to perfection. The service was fine, but overall the experience left us disappointed.",1," April 18, 2016"
1530,Awesome Experience! Great food and atmosphere!,5," April 15, 2016"
1531,"Following an extremely busy and taxing day at the office, my colleagues and I visit Fogo on a Thursday night and were so satisfied with the service, the wine and the food! Everything was delicious and the meats and chickens were to die for. Especially the house special and the filet mignone. The salad bar is filled to the brim with every delicious option you could ever want! And dessert was a must! The molten chocolate cake and the caramel dessert were divine. Highly recommend a visit!",5," April 14, 2016"

1533,"I've frequented many Brazilian steakhouses (churrascarias) in Mass and Fogo de Chao was certainly one of the best. My personal favorite (by a large margin) is the Brazilian Grill in Hyannis. That being said, Fogo had a solid buffet and a good meat selection. The ambiance and service were impeccable. My only issues were: 1) a significant amount of the meats being served were overcooked, dry, or under-salted, and 2) it was pricey for the quality of the food, at around $60 per person (buffet and rodizio) - for contrast, my favorite Brazilian grill costs around $33.",3," April 13, 2016"
1534,The staff and service was outstanding! The food was phenomenal! Will definitely be returning!,5," April 10, 2016"
1535,"This was my first time at Fogo de Chao, my husband had been there before. We had an awesome experience. Food was so good, we left uncomfortably full because we couldn't stop trying different cuts of meats! I seriously can't wait to go back!",5," April 10, 2016"
1536,"We used to go to a branch of Fogo de Chao in Texas (when we lived there) and it was fabulous. While touring colleges in Boston, my daughter saw Fogo and begged to go to dinner there one night... everything looked the same... everything did not taste the same, for sure!<br/><br/>So much salt! Every single piece of meat, chicken, beef, pork all of it : laden with salt!  Really could not eat much of it. The salad bar is wonderful and plentiful so that was our salvation.  They price your meal as if you will gorge upon meat - so, if you don't, it becomes one expensive salad!<br/><br/>Would not recommend.",2," April 10, 2016"
1537,Outstanding services from the waitress and also customer services.,5," April 10, 2016"
1538,"Nice place it was my first time at a Brazilian restaurant. Food was very tasty! And lots of nice options. I was expecting something a little more intimate and quiet/romantic but it was the complete opposite.  My fault for assuming though. VERY VERY energetic and noisy. Almost too much, staff were running around like mad the entire time it seemed. I almost felt like I had to keep my head down in my plate so I didn't get anxious. Was a bit hard to sit back and relax and enjoy my meal because there was so much going on.  But overall good experience, great for people who like to eat a lot!",3," April 9, 2016"
1539,The buffet is a little pricey especially if you don't eat more than one plate. The food is very good but it takes forever to receive and pay the bill. This was my third time there and it was about 20-30 mins each time to pay the bill.,4," April 9, 2016"
1540,"Wine list was obnoxiously expensive.More than 300% mark up compare all the expensive restaurants around Boston. we did order any.<br/>Also we ordered Grey goose martini with a splash of cranberry and it was served with stuffed olives .not a good combination, instead of the lime we asked for.<br/>waitress was not friendly and patient <br/>!!!!",5," April 9, 2016"

1544,"As well as we enjoy the FOGO experience ,this visit could have used a bit more service .<br/>We are not new to FOGO as we have visited several other sites. This is the first time <br/>we had to ask several times for a goucho to serve us which we are not used to when we visit a FOGO.<br/>Hopefully this is a one time problem .<br/>SEE YOU SOON",4," April 3, 2016"
1545,Great !!!!!,5," April 1, 2016"
1546,This is my 5th visit and it keeps on getting better. Delicious well-seasoned meats and plenty of it. Best steakhouse yet and I've been to plenty of steakhouses.,5," April 1, 2016"
1547,The meat was over cooked. Times and times again I asked the servers to give me the medium rare pieces. They tried but they only had well done or medium well pieces to offer. Very disappointed to have to pay this price for dinner and didn't enjoy it.,3," March 30, 2016"
1548,"Went w two grown children and husband for Easter dinner.  Food was great, some of the best steak I have ever had.  A little disappointed with the side section.  I would have liked to see more Brazilean fare and sides. <br/>The martinis were terrific but I felt the desserts fell short. I had Carmelized pineapple and the fruit was so in ripe I couldn't eat it. My son had flan which was average and my daughter had a lava cake which was fine. The desserts were expensive and totally not worth it. <br/>Although we had to ask several times for milk for my coffee the rest of the service was perfect. <br/>We would go again",4," March 27, 2016"
1549,"Went to Fogo de Chao to celebrate a birthday with a friend this past weekend.  The food was phenomenal - fresh, flavorful and plentiful.  The server was friendly and attentive, constantly refilling our side dishes and beverages.  This place is great for a fun night out with the girls or a special occasion.  I will definitely be dining there again.",5," March 19, 2016"

1551,Always delicious!,5," March 16, 2016"
1552,"Whether you eat meat or not, Fogo de Ch√£o is a great place to enjoy high quality food. Their salad bar is hard to stay away from, even if you're the most die-hard carnivore (eg: Mango &amp; wild black rice, marinated oyster mushrooms, feijoada bar). The meat itself is absolutely amazing. The way Brazilian butchers cut their meat is exceptional, and you end up with some really delicious cuts that are hard to find in the US. <br/><br/>The waitstaff are extremely warm yet professional. It's an expensive place to eat, and that's also reflected in their service: top notch. Caipirinha's are great, but WAY too expensive considering what's in it.<br/><br/>The price tag understandably makes this place only feasible once in awhile, but you really do get a lot for your dollar. Lunch is a little cheaper, so if you'd like to save about $15 per person, go for it. Most Churrascarias I've been to include dessert with the meal: this one doesn't, not that I had any room for dessert.",5," March 16, 2016"
1553,Would recommend this place to anyone and definitely would come back.:),4," March 13, 2016"
1554,"Fogo de Chao is hard to review because it had such strengths and weaknesses.  On a recent visit with teenage and twenty-something boys and men, the endless supply of meat was not be matched from a value perspective.  Ambiance itself was festive and the place looked good.  On the other hand, sometimes it was unclear who was responsible for our table when we had a concern - a major weakness relative to similarly priced (and even more modest) restaurants.  The food itself was actually pretty good.  The meat freshly grilled in myriad varieties could be quite impressive when we chose the right cuts.  As well, the sides that came with the meat and the endless salad bar were both quite strong.  In fact, ladies among us only had the salad bar and were very happy.  I would not choose this restaurant for service or food novelty.  However, entertaining young carnivores with endless appetites, Fogo de Chao worked very well -- those carnivores left sated and happy.",3," March 13, 2016"
1555,"We had been wanting to go to a Brazilian Steak house because my son hates waiting in restaurants.  For his 16th birthday we took him and his 19 year old brother and another family. There was absolutely no waiting and the market salad bar was amazing as was all the meat that paraded around the table constantly.  The food was fresh, the atmosphere was great for a group, and the staff was wonderful.",5," March 12, 2016"
1556,"We were visiting from California for a conference and seen this restaurant next door. Decided to go in for a late dinner and was completely satisfied from beginning to end. We spent over 2 hours eating and throughly enjoying the experience. If you love your meats, this is a must eat! The best restaurant we went to on our trip!",5," March 11, 2016"
1557,"Very tired cold table, decoration of good quality. This place has something special that makes you very good about yourself while waiting for the excellent service of care staff. I should mention, the lamb ribs are divine.",5," March 10, 2016"
1558,"This was my 3rd visit to Fogo de Chao (Boston) and each time I've shared my dining experience with a different friend.  I hoped that they would enjoy the dining experience as much as I have...and they did.  We were unaware that such a place existed.  Fogo de Chao represents the true meaning of what a ""steakhouse"" should be.  Staff were attentive to our requests  for our meats to be served well-done.  There's nothing more frustrating than making the request for well-done and not receiving well-done.  A mistake like that can change one's appetite and mood.  We were happy, happy, happy! <br/><br/>The meats are nicely seasoned/flavored.  While I enjoy the beef, my favorite are the lamb chops...so tender and flavorful.<br/><br/>I've already made reservations for my 4th visit and will bring a 1st timer to share the experience with me.  Each time I've dined at Fogo de Chao, it has truly been a great experience",5," March 10, 2016"
1559,Amazing food! Excellent veggie table options! And the meat.....no comparison! Meatlovers heaven!,5," March 7, 2016"
1560,Great experience at the place where I celebrated my birthday.,4," March 6, 2016"
1561,"The servers are a bit rush, but understandable. Foods are generally pleasing, wine list is complete and affordable",4," March 6, 2016"
1562,"Second time here, and the experience was like the first. Best meats are the pork ribs and the chicken legs. Both moist and very flavorful. The lamb was a little disappointing, but maybe I just had an off-piece. There are two kinds of steak; select the premium over the sirloin. Service as usual was terrific, and the salad bar outstanding, particularly the salmon.  I will definitely return, but for the price, perhaps some of the meats could be a little better. PS: I love the Xingu beer, but at $10, it's a little expensive.",3," March 6, 2016"
1563,"For the amount you pay for average-quality all you can eat meat at Fogo, you could fill up on a much nicer steak at a number of other restaurants.  That said, it's a fun gimmick and if all-you-can eat is your thing, Fogo is the way to go.",3," March 5, 2016"
1564,"Expensive - $200 for 2 people (we each had 2 premium drinks), but for a special splurge, it is great. The food is delicious &amp; well prepared. The lay out of the restaurant is good - I ate at the Beverly Hills location and  it felt cramped and crowded. The Boston location is much more comfortable. The waiter at said, ""it's wicked rare"" referring to the doneness of some meat - I liked that there was a local Boston vibe.",5," February 29, 2016"
1565,"I thought the quality of the salad/side food bar was inferior to the meat quality.  However, overall this is a great place to eat.",4," February 29, 2016"
1566,"Good was good, but not outstanding and not really worth for the price.",4," February 28, 2016"
1567,"I am a Gaucho from Brazil and live in the USA for 20 years. If there are anyone that knows about the Brazilian BBQ (Churrasco) it is me. I have been in other Fogo de chao in other states in the USA and had a much better experience. My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and decided to drive from Springfield MA to this restaurant to have a nice romantic dinner. We drove 2 hours for our 8:30pm reservation. We ended up leaving the restaurant at 8:55pm because the steak was never coming to our table and when it came it was burnt and hard to bite. I complained that not all types of meat were coming, that we were getting max 3-4 kinds and they seemed to be all left overs, cold and hard to bite. We did get one picanha that was delicious after we complained but that was all. The waitress even asked us why are we leaving so quickly and I was not going to say anything, but since she asked I told her the issues and I thought she was going to at least give us a discount and nothing happened. We paid almost $150.00 and it was a disaster. We were going to drink alcohol and stay there for a while enjoying each other and sen much more than $150, but things did not go as we planned. I am very dissapoited!",2," February 27, 2016"
1568,Fabulous Restaurant! Great Staff....perfect service! Love this restaurant!,5," February 27, 2016"
1569,"As is typical in Brazilian steakhouses, servers traverse the room with different cuts of meat on skewers. We were at our table for 2.5 hours and saw the servers with good cuts of steak (filet, sirloin) exactly once. I asked several times for them to send steak over and every time we got the cheap bottom of the round (which is quite tasty). We had frequent visits from servers with sausage, chicken legs, etc.  It was obvious that they were rationing. Given that the bill w tip was nearly $700 for seven people ... Not good.  We won't be back.",2," February 27, 2016"
1570,"Decided to give the Fog in Boston another chance after the last time and once again they fell short of providing good to excellent service.  The head waitress was very good but seldom cam was far back as our table and when she did I had to let her know that it had been several minutes since the last skewer of meat had been by.<br/><br/>I won't stop recommending this place because it is an experience,  but I won't go back",4," February 27, 2016"
1571,"My overall review was that this place was over rated as far as everything goes, the food and service fell short to my expectations. This place was horrible.",1," February 27, 2016"
1572,"We plan a group meal once a year. You need to be prepared. I've never eaten dinner the night we do our lunch. The variety of meats is ourstanding. They bring you the meat the way you request it. The sides are also great. And, if you have a non-meat person, the salad bar is crazy.",5," February 26, 2016"
1573,"Having heard good reviews for the restaurant, we decided to book a table of 4. <br/>The initial welcome was good, and the process explained well for the dining.<br/>The salad bar and meats were very salty indeed, the table bites were flavoursome.<br/>Whilst having a rest and the card turned red, we were repeatedly harassed by waiting staff to continue on multiple occasions, which didn't allow table conversation due to the constant interruptions. The practice of waiters walking around with trays overhanging from an outstretched arm above them resulted in our table being soaked as a waiter bumping in to it. The waiters were far to personal on their comments during their conversations, I do not wish to know about their home life and girlfriends. Having spent 4 nights in NY and 4 nights in Boston this was by far the worst meal of the holiday, to the point I begrudged paying the bill and especially the enforced tip.  Walked away from the restaurant feeling robbed of my money.",2," February 24, 2016"
1574,"Granted, the salad/apps bar is unlimited and wonderful.  The meat selection (also unlimited) is interesting and varied, but quite frequently overcooked and dry.  I'm sure this is a real bargain for big appetites, but for light to normal eaters it is just too much, and there are no options.  Very big meal and very big bill, especially if you like wine and dessert.",3," February 21, 2016"
1575,Everything was as wonderful at lunch as it is at dinner,5," February 21, 2016"
1576,"Joe was the best waiter anyone could ask for. He made our night fun, and amusing.",5," February 20, 2016"
1577,I've been to Fogo many times and always wanted my brother who is a chef to experience it. So when him and his wife came to stay from England I knew I had to take them there. From the atmosphere to the salad bar to the cocktails to the selection of meats; they were amazed and loved every minute. It is on the higher price range but for a special occasion it is totally worth it. I would go there once a week if I could afford it. The food is much more superior to any other Brazilian restaurants I have been to. The meat is top notch.,5," February 19, 2016"
1578,"This was my first visit to Fogo de Chao, and it was remarkably similar to churrascarias we've eaten at in Rio de Janeiro.  Food was plentiful and tasty, and the service was attentive.  The risk, here, is overeating, maybe because the price is so high (about $52/person before drinks), making one want to maximize the value.  Still, it was fun, and delicious, and might be a nice place to bring the family for a special birthday.",4," February 16, 2016"
1579,"We have eaten here many times, most recently for Valentine's Day.  The food here never disappoints.  The service level can vary depending on the night with some waiters more responsive than others.  I would encourage Fogo's management to look into this as service is becoming a weak spot in an otherwise wonderful venue.",4," February 15, 2016"
1580,"The waiters and waitresses were definitely on point. The food was hit or miss - some pieces of meat were really juicy and succulent while others were overcooked or way too salty. The salad bar was great! They had smoked salmon and mozzarella balls which were pretty decent. This seating is pretty cramped, however.",4," February 15, 2016"
1581,"Been to other Brazilian Steakhouses and had better experiences. Service has been similar, and meat great. The dessert was NOT worth the price. I love grilled pineapple, but what we got was one small round of pineapple that was only caramelized on the top. Very tiny scoop of vanilla. Oh well. Wouldn't go back.",4," February 15, 2016"
1582,Good ambiance but all foods were very salty.,3," February 14, 2016"
1583,"I was over all disappointed this time around. My husband and me look forward to dining here once a year on Valentine's Day to be specific. I understand it was really busy that night, but we didn't get a full variety of meats. I was looking forward to endless cheese balls which are amazing by the way. Once we finished they never came back with more. But food was delicious just wish we had more.",3," February 14, 2016"
1584,Very expensive,4," February 14, 2016"
1585,Food is great but service is really poor when its busy.. They shouldbreally have enough servers to constantly gonaround.. For every meat i would have to wait 20 minutes.. And i ordered a lemonade and it came 40 minutes later.. I ordered a refill and i never got it.. Service needs to improove.,3," February 14, 2016"
1586,"We were not first time customers. We had a reservation and we were promptly seated.  The restaurant was not busy just yet.  Confusing waiter service. My partner got her drink promptly while I had to wait unusually long for my sangria.  After finishing  our salad bar course, we flipped our service coins. We had to ask for dinner plates. The side dishes for all the tables around us came out including to one table who hadn't even gone to the salad bar yet.  We asked a waiter for our sides and he responded they would be out shortly. In fact they didn't come out and when he delivered them he readily admitted he lied and apologized for the delay. The gauchos were very disorganized and walked by the table several times without stopping.  The meat was either very overcooked or extremely undercooked. The food quality was no where near what it had been on our previous visits. We didn't bother with dessert. We did receive a Bogo coupon to be used before the end of April. I do not think we will be returning anytime soon.   I wonder if Texas de Brazil will ever open a place in Boston.",2," February 14, 2016"
1587,"To start off on Valentine's Day how do you decide to not have the Valet available at the restaurant that day. So they sent us to the hotel Valet which was fine, we were sat immediately upon arrival. The waitress was very nice and have no complaints about her. The meat however was either charred and tastes burnt or it was too bloody and being a Brazilian steakhouse how do you not offer skirt steak ""Churrasco"" while we say they only passed 2 cuts of beef, 1 very salty chicken, and 1 sausage, so after filling up with the sides offered and getting ready to leave they decided to start offering lamb and other cuts that never made it to us after being there almost 2 hours. They didn't decorate or make it look any different for the Valentines holiday. To finish it all off when we go to the Valet to get the car it took 40 minutes to retrieve our car and there was no heater inside in the waiting area on the coldest day of 2016. Not happy at all with this place.",3," February 14, 2016"
1588,Waitress was very nice!,4," February 14, 2016"
1589,"If you are into meats, whether that be steak, chicken, lamb, pork, etc they have it!  If you have never been, lets put it this way, YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!  <br/><br/>Yes dinner is $52 but trust me its well worth it.  You probably get about $30-40 worth of meats and the ""salad"" bar (has only 1 salad, ceasar) will make it all worth it!<br/><br/>JUST GO ALREADY!",5," February 14, 2016"
1590,"I've been to several Fogo locations and always had a wonderful meal. This was my first time dinning in the Boston location. I was disappointed that that with the range of meats that the restaurant is known for, I consistently saw the same items appearing at my table as all the others went by and I was not able to enjoy them...",4," February 13, 2016"
1591,First time I came to this restaurant! Food was excellent as was the service! 16 different meats to choose from and an all you can eat healthy type of eating! Came here for Valentine's Day and my wife absolutely loved it! Eat with elegance and at a very fair price! I spent less than what I thought I would and left wit a full stomach!,5," February 13, 2016"
1592,"I've been wanting to bring my husband here for two years and they did not disappoint. The food is amazing and it's a very unique atmosphere. The only downfall was because it was Valentine's Day, it was packed with people. Not alt of noise, but my husband fell is in love with the NY steak and couldn't find the waiter who had it for about 15 minutes. However, all the staff are willing to help and another waiter was nice enough to personally bring over the steak. We loved this restaurant!",5," February 13, 2016"
1593,"This was our first time in this restaurant, as we selected it for Valentine's dinner with a large group of friends.<br/>The food was excellent. The sumptuous buffet boasted an abundance of delicious offerings from amazing sweet potato (with something else) soup to variety of tasty salads and veggies (hearts of palm was my favorite!), to smoked salmon with capers.<br/>The meat was the highlight of the dinner, even though some of our non-carnivorous people preferred fish. All of us agreed that lamb chops were the most amazing choice of all meats.<br/>I gave 4 stars for the service just because of feeling a bit of rush all around, I think it may be a side effect of dining on the busiest night. Other than that, the waiter was attentive, polite and helpful. <br/>All in all it was an excellent choice for Valentine's night. We plan to come back!",5," February 13, 2016"
1594,"This is a great place for a group celebration.  Wonderful atmosphere and the dining style makes for good conversation and the ability to get up and move around.  Of course, the meat they bring to the table is delicious but the salad bar is also unbelievable for variety and quality.  They had a delicious butternut squash and sweet potato soup when we went this time that was a big hit with all of our group.  Cocktails are also very good.",5," February 13, 2016"
1595,"Best feeling I've had out to eat! Great servers, eat right away, portions excellent, it has it all! Except for to-go plates!!! I had mine so ready to go... The server even gave me the last lamb chop knowing I was asking for it. Then the bamboozlement! No to-go... Luckily EVERYTHING else is awesome! I love my food and Fo-Go is FoSho!!!",4," February 12, 2016"
1596,"So I've been to a number of Brazilian Steakhouses and have always found them to be awesome, and Fogo's food was nothing short of delicious, hot, and fresh, but the ambiance was what surprised my boyfriend and I, leaving us underwhelmed about our experience. We went on a Friday night at 9pm for dinner, our table was at the back of the restaurant near the windows. While heading to our table we had to squeeze through a number of closely packed tables filled with people. Once seated at our table we realized we were nearly sitting on top of a radiator and literally sweated the entire dinner. We honestly rushed to finish our food so we could get up and make the long, winding, crowded walk back to the buffet just to get a break from the immense heat. (To be fair we never asked to be moved, however, until about the end of the dinner there were no other small tables open for 2 people.) Beyond that, as we were sitting both of us found the setting to feel like a slightly upscale cafeteria, as it was large, fairly loud, and lacked any sense of romanticism or intimicacy. It really would only be well suited for large groups. We kept saying as well that we couldn't look around the room and find a table that we would've preferred to sit at. The service was also neither here nor there. It was standard, nothing impressive but was suffice and timely enough. Anyway like I said, the food was amazing and just what you'd expect at a great Brazilian steakhouse, but as for ambiance, noise and setting, especially for what is supposed to be a higher-end restaurant...we were disappointed. Would recommend for a weeknight dinner or lunch when less crowded or for larger groups only.",3," February 12, 2016"
1597,"My two twenty something sons were delighted by the bountiful and totally delicious meat offerings.  The salad bar was fit for any vegetarian and had great choices.  All in all, the perfect bday spot for a special dinner for the boys!",4," February 12, 2016"
1598,Our new favorite restaurant in Boston!,5," February 12, 2016"
1599,"My husband and I celebrated Valentine's Day this year with a delicious lunch at Fogo de Chao. We very much enjoyed the first course (salad bar), the included sides, and of course - the variety of excellent meats. We left very full and satisfied!",5," February 12, 2016"
1600,They have so many different cuts of meat it's fantastic! Their salad bar is extensive and nice.  Everything was perfect minus the service. Our waiter constantly stood by our table and had conversations with other servers which after 10 minutes turned on the uncomfortable side. I have been to Fogo multiple times and the service is always good with attentive staff but on this occasion I feel like we were being slightly rushed even though the restaurant was nowhere near full capacity on a weekday night at 6.,4," February 11, 2016"
1601,"My wife and I have eaten at other locations and Fogo has never let us down. The food is amazing, the staff is cheerful, attentive, and friendly. Fogo de Chao is definitely a keeper. We had reservations for dinner and there was no wait at all. Valet parking is available, so downtown Boston traffic is not an issue. For beginning-to-end outstanding service and awesome food, Fogo is a must!",5," February 11, 2016"
1602,Our family of eight enjoyed steak and the market bar.  Our reserved table was ready when we arrived.  We took our time and did not feel rushed.  The meat was delicious as was the salad bar and desserts.  The waiter brought one side of each to our table of eight.  They did not replenish them....disappointing.  The service for drinks was very slow.   All in all a fair dinner.  Could be better for the price.,3," February 6, 2016"
1603,"My husband and I wanted to try something different...well this is the place!  It is all you can eat salad bar/side dishes and with all different meats.  You get a green card (meaning:  keep the meat coming) or turn it over for a red card (meaning:  I need to take a break..lol)<br/>The salad bar had quite a few selections of different side dishes along with two types of soup.  I had the Butternut Squash bisque...delicious. The meats were so tender I did not need a knife!  My favorite was the parmesan pork tenderloin.  My husband loved the lamb.  Overall, we will definitely go again.",4," February 6, 2016"
1604,"Our experience at this restaurant was awful. Every cut of meat came out shamefully overcooked. We repeatedly asked for medium rare or even medium temperature for the meats and consistently received well done. The sides and market bar were also subpar - cold and looked and tasted as if they had been sitting in the kitchen for hours. The best part of the meal was the cheese bread, and for the price that's really sad. We will absolutely not be back or recommend this place to anyone else. We will happily give our business to the competition instead in the future.",1," February 4, 2016"
1605,"Fogo de Chao gives you a true Brazilian experience.  The Market Table is filled with all kinds of wonderful salads, meats, and cheeses.  A separate table has black beans, rice, soup of the day, etc.  Service is excellent.  The gauchos continue to bring you meat, chicken, lamb, and pork on skewers for your dining enjoyment and plates of mashed potatoes, bananas, and cheese bread are refilled as quickly as you eat them.  You will never leave hungry.  For non-meat eaters, you can order just the Market Table or the Sea Bass selection.  They also have Shrimp Cocktail available to order.  Fogo de Chao offers desserts but unfortunately we did not leave room for that.  We will be returning in the near future for the food and the royal treatment.",5," February 4, 2016"
1606,"I had lunch with my bf for celebrated his birthday on February,04 . All everything was great!! And just made our special day perfect:) thanks again for service",5," February 4, 2016"
1607,It was great but compared to other Fogo de Chao the salad bar was laking and the meet varaity seems to be smaler.,4," February 2, 2016"
1608,"While the food is excellent, it is way overpriced. The ambiance is no better than a typical chain restaurant. I've been to Brazilian steakhouses that are much more interesting and fun. However, it's an experience worth trying once.",2," January 31, 2016"
1609,"The food is great, the venue beautiful. Overall a great experience. Waiters are a bit pushy to make you order out of the main buffet menu, but friendly",4," January 31, 2016"
1610,"Not as much variety as I would have hoped for but it was lunch. Meat was all WAY too salty, could barely taste flavor.",3," January 31, 2016"
1611,"Good special occasion restaurant, but we found it overpriced, especially for younger teen diners without big appetites. We paid nearly $400 for a family of five, and this was with no alcoholic beverages. We enjoyed the experience, but would not dine here often.",3," January 27, 2016"
1612,Just wish that the ticket in the door was cheaper. Honestly i'd rather go to a nice steakhouse than get an all you can eat at this point.,4," January 26, 2016"
1613,"This is a place that you will never complain about the food portion sizes. The food on the buffet table was fit for a king in itself and everything was super fresh.  The maple bacon was incredible as was the gluten free bread which was more like a turnover with a cheesy twist.  The servers who go around from the table serving different custard of meat were always within reach and very good at explaining what they are about to share with you.  The waiter is always checking to see if you need a plate cleared, more side dishes from the kitchen, water, or anything else you need, but never in your face about it.  I would recommend this place to eat if you love meat.  My only issue from holding them back from the 5th star was that all pork I had was way over cooked and very dry. I would definitely eat here again and figure that the pork can only get better.",4," January 23, 2016"
1614,"Had heard rave reviews about the restaurant, but we were disappointed.  The salad bar was incredible and I would go back for that.  The meat was okay some tastier than others - I don't know why they ask how you want the meat prepared because we always asked for medium and had everything from very rare to well done. I typically love chicken and pork, but couldn't eat what was served as it was dry and tasteless.  The drinks and desserts were good but very expensive.  The service was spectacular.  The restaurant was spotless (even on a snow stormy day).  The dinner price of $51.95 wouldn't have been bad if the food lived up to the expectations.  However, it didn't - add on a drink, coffee and one dessert (shared) and the evening was not a good value.  Valet parking on the other hand was a great value for Boston ($15).",3," January 23, 2016"
1615,"The food was outstanding and certainly exceeded my expectations. The staff was attentive and polite, true professionals in every role. I look forward to returning for more great meals and will be recommending this restaurant to both friends and colleagues.",5," January 22, 2016"
1616,Super service excellent food from salad bar to dessert. You could make a meal of the salad bar. The maple sugar bacon is to die for.,5," January 21, 2016"
1617,"I‚Äôve been to Fogo de Chao for lunch during the week and had a much better experience than my holiday weekend dinner experience.  Restaurant was crowded and loud, but fortunately my reservation was honored a half hour early.  Bartender completely ignored us as I waited with my husband to grab a drink while our table was getting ready, so we skipped the first drink.  We were greeted upon being seated and the menu was explained to us.  Salad bar was basically running low, if not out of, most items and the croutons were stale.  None of the hot items were present, and there were lines of people waiting for the refills.  Due to the crowded restaurant, meat servers and general drink service was pretty slow, and I felt like we weren‚Äôt getting a good variety of red meat vs. chickens/pork as the skewers were passed around.  Maybe It is because I‚Äôm not a big red meat eater, but for what you pay to eat here, I just don‚Äôt see the value as I filled up pretty quick.  My husband is a big red meat guy, and he seemed pleased.  It took a while to get another glass of wine (wine list was great by the way) but they ran out of what I wanted, so I passed on this too because of how long it was taking for everything.  I'd probably go back and pay half the price for a lunch during the week since the restaurant is less crowded, quieter, and the service is better.",3," January 17, 2016"
1618,"Nice take on the Brazilian grill theme.  Lots of high quality fresh salads and things to start.  Service was actually surprisingly spotty.  No issue with the various meats coming around, but service from the general waitstaff was very slow.  Price seems quite high for what you get.  I'd recommend for folks looking for something a bit different, especially with a group, but I'd also warn that price is high.",4," January 17, 2016"
1619,very expensive for the service and food they serve,1," January 16, 2016"
1620,"My friends and I had a lot of fun. definitely expensive, but worth it.",5," January 16, 2016"
1621,Food is always delicious! The waiter was fantastic I wish we got his name. We've been here twice and he's been our waiter both times. You can tell he loves his job and the company he works for.,5," January 15, 2016"
1622,"So I've been to this restaurant twice. First time was incredible. That was my anniversary and my partner and I had a really lovely time. The food is phenomenal and the wine list is very good. <br/><br/>However, my second time I decided to go with a group (my parents were in town visiting). We had five people and got placed at a table in the very center of the restaurant. There was a family beside us that had these two kids that were just out of control. They were shrieking and throwing things at one another. The restaurant did nothing about it so finally we asked to be moved and got relocated to a table that shouldn't even exist. It was right in front of where the wait staff get their spare plates and cutlery. It was even noisier and my poor father got bumped twice on the head as a waiter tried to go over his head with a pile of plates. We all lost our appetites due to frustration and this extremely expensive meal ended up being a waste of money. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this restaurant for the food (it's incredible and worth the price), but I'd also caution diners to be careful of where they are seated and who is sitting next to them, because god help you you if you get seated next to screaming children and your luxurious evening becomes a waste of time and money.",2," January 15, 2016"
1623,"First tip, GO HUNGRY! You must be prepared to indulge in so many dishes, from the salad bar, to the sides, and of course the endless options of meat. Everything is great quality and served to taste. The drink selection is also very notable whether you are in the mood for wine or bar service.<br/><br/>I also have to mention that I have visited Fogo de Chao in both Manhattan and Boston on a few occasions, and am always amazed with the exceptional service that is provided. With that said, this most recent visit to the Boston location was the best. <br/><br/>Fogo de Chao will most certainly stay on my list for a reliable and go-to dinner establishments!",5," January 8, 2016"
1624,"Very expensive but a fun experience. Great for hosting folks from out of town, for special occasions, or for group celebrations. Food is plentiful and delicious, and the service is warm and prompt.",5," January 3, 2016"
1625,Looking for somewhere to celebrate that birthday or anniversary?   This is the spot.... from the salad bar with its impeccable selection to the sides brought to the table to finally the meats. Every cut is perfectlying cooked and delicious. Highly recommend  the bacon wrapped chicken. Don't miss out!,5," January 2, 2016"
1626,The meat was outstanding and the buffet was large and well stocked. It was a great experience.,5," January 2, 2016"
1627,Food is good. But you have to wave your hand for everything. NO one comes.<br/><br/>Took 15 min to ask for drinks.<br/>Had to wave to ask for water<br/>Had to wave to ask for milk with coffee<br/>had to wave to ask for dessert menu<br/>had to wave and talk to servers to get the different meats to come our way.<br/>They dont bring out the good meats. unless you ask someone. They will bring out the same cheap stuff ( chicken legs) 50 times. <br/>Same waiter seemed to be serving 20 tables at once. Restaurant was 1/2 empty but waiter could not handle that many tables.<br/><br/>This was a good restaurant when it opened. Now I am not going to go anymore.,2," January 2, 2016"
1628,"This was our 3rd family celebration at Fogo de Chao.  We were seated on time, the staff was very attentive and we found the food wonderful.  The buffets were well stocked and fresh, the meat that was served was plentiful, hot, flavorful and delicious.",4," January 1, 2016"
1629,"This is our 4th and likely last visit to the boston fogo de chao location. We have eaten at fogo  Las Vegas and Orlando and tonight was dreadful. Our waitress Anna greeted us and was never seen again except to deliver our check. We waited 45 minutes for our mashed potatoes, the market table had no bacon and on a return trip,still no bacon. Basic and simple expectations such as sugar for a cup of tea were missed and we had to ask for mediocre service. The location opened at 5:00. We had a 5 pm reservation. We were not seated until 5:30. As for meat choices served, only 4 were offered by gauchos, 1 pork, two beef and one chicken.  Gauchos walked passed our table multiple times despite the green card clearly facing up. We requested medium rare beef and our meat was cut rare on the ""house special.""  I do not mind spending good money for a meal that is worth the money spent. Tonight I left this experience feeling I made a big mistake. What a shame. We won't return in Boston.",1," January 1, 2016"
1630,"I have been to Fogo de Chao restaurants in other cities and I normally like the experience. This is why we chose this restaurant for our NYE dinner. The ambiance was perfect and in a very convenient location, close to where all the First Night activities were taking place. In general, the food was good. The highlight was the market table (and this is the reason why I give 3 stars and not less), which is absolutely delicious; it includes a great variety of cold appetizers and salads, as well as some fruit and bread. The big risk is that we tend to eat a lot from the market table and we leave too little space for the meat. But in this opportunity it was the right call since the meat was far from exceptional. In fact, we found that many of the cuts had too much fat, they were very oily and also very salty. The only meat that we liked was the picanha, which is the signature cut, but we were really disappointed about the others. We were really surprised about this, because in previous times we had left the restaurant absolutely satisfied with the food. But it was not the case this time because we had high expectations about the meat, which were not met.",3," December 31, 2015"
1631,"We wre there on December , 31 and we had a great time, the food was great, no negative comments.",5," December 31, 2015"
1632,Wonderful dining experience. Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating. The food was phenomenal and well worth the money. I would highly recommend this dining establishment.,5," December 31, 2015"
1633,"I have been in the hospitality business for over 30 years and this place gets it right each and every time.  From the time you walk in to the service team to the meat carvers, they are all top notch and caring people.  The food selections and variety are remarkable and the quality of meat is truly second to none.  It has become our ""go to"" place in the city.  Great vibe, great staff, great food... And great value... What else is there",5," December 31, 2015"
1634,Amazing experience. We brought our friends from out of town to celebrate New Years Eve.   The food was delicious.  The kids loved being able to choose their meat and to switch the card from red to green.  The drinks were VERY good.  We will be back again.,5," December 31, 2015"
1635,"Not the experience we expected. Server was rushed.  The ambiance was a bit chaotic with waiters buzzing around and large open dining room. Very expensive, although meats were tasty and tender.",4," December 30, 2015"
1636,If your going here you need to bring your appetite. The market salad bar has tons to choose from and the meats are all delicious.,4," December 30, 2015"
1637,"Fogo de chao is good for foodies and for a new kind of dining experience. The food was good but not great. The kinds of meat were not varied at that time. There wasnt any lamb. Overall, it's still worth the experience.",4," December 30, 2015"
1638,"The food, service, and presentation were good.  We had a group of six. The service was excellent, but It was not a particularly busy night.  We needed to pace ourselves because the food was plentiful and came quickly until we started to slow ourselves down.  Everything that we had was delicious.",5," December 28, 2015"
1639,"We had a birthday celebration for my niece.  They placed us in a relatively quiet area as requested.<br/><br/>The service was excellent.  The Market Table is one of the best salad bars I've seen.  But, the  meat was too salty for our tastes.<br/><br/>Probably would not repeat.",3," December 27, 2015"
1640,"A friend told me about Fogo de Chao and went into great detail. I had to try the food based on the friend's glowing review. OMG!!! Now this was a great dining experience! No need to choose one OR the other meat; I could try all the meats...and for the same price I would have spent at another ""steakhouse"" with one meat selection. Now this is what I call a STEAKHOUSE. While I don't eat pork and love beef, the lamb chops were my favorite - tasty and tender. Thank you for seasoning your meats. Plus, my waiters were fabulous. While this was my first visit, I was back 3 days later with another friend.",5," December 27, 2015"
1641,"The restaurant has a great environment for special occasion. I have been going to Fogo in Chicago for many years. However, this was my first visit at the Boston location. The meat here was over-cooked and tasted very dry, the meat cut was wrong and made it hard to chew.  Even the lamb chops were all over-cooked. The standard do not seem to be the same as they are in Chicago. This Boston location need improvements.",3," December 27, 2015"
1642,"Wow, if you are a red meat lover this is a pretty great place.  While not absolutely everything is a hit out of the park, the many beef and lamb offerings were quite tasty and tender (chicken wrapped in bacon, a bit dry).  Salad bar had plenty of delicious choices.",4," December 25, 2015"
1643,"The restaurant is good but they cannot handle the large crowd of a major holiday. Seated late, food late (they pass around with the meat cuts but somehow you can be late doing it) even getting the bill took forever and they got it wrong the first time. Really under the water.  You pay 50+ for the service, this time is was not worth it.",2," December 25, 2015"
1644,We went there on Christmas for dinner with my brother who is in a scooter and has limited mobility.  The Manager worked with us the night before we went there and when we arrived to make sure he was comfortable and we were all set.  They aren't ideal for handicapped (narrow between tables and no arms on chairs) but they very much made it work for us.  I was very thankful and appreciated all his help.<br/><br/>Our server was excellent and very personable.  Food was plentiful and very good.<br/><br/>Thanks for making our Christmas dinner memorable.,5," December 25, 2015"
1645,A really lovely evening. Great food and so much! The ribs and garlic steak were exceptional.,5," December 25, 2015"
1646,"We made reservations for Christmas night. I thought it might be quiet ....to the contrary. The dining room was Full, Fun and Excellent! Anna helped us navigate the evening making sure we got the best experience possible. It was my mother's first visit and Anna made her feel over the top welcome....it was mush appreciated. The market table was delicious, diverse, fresh and abundant. Each staff member we encountered was welcoming and professional. The crew who was working Christmas night had TEAM down to a science! Thank you for a lovely evening.",5," December 25, 2015"
1647,"Highly recommended for a special night out...just make sure you're hungry when you get there!  While it's extremely difficult to avoid overfilling your plate at the ""Market Place"" salad bar, you will regret it if you don't leave plenty of room for all of the delicious meats being brought to your table by the waitstaff.",4," December 24, 2015"
1648,Our waitress clearly was not happy to work on xmas eve. Never came to our table after the initial order and she got our wine order wrong.   Had to flag other waitresses to get service.  Bill was wrong too.  Food was good and the other employees were good though,3," December 24, 2015"
1649,"Fogo de Chao did a great job accommodating our group, which included a vegetarian, a dairy allergic person and gluten intolerant guests.   Every enjoyed their meal.",5," December 23, 2015"
1650,Well tonight a bit rushed. We are not finished with our salads and did not turn over to green card yet and they left the mashed potatoes and polenta and bananas to get cold before the meat came. Also noticed they kept trying to serve one of the meats more them anything else. Had to ask to lamb chops and need ribs,4," December 19, 2015"
1651,"The huge salad bar with so many choices was a great accompaniment to the fabulous beef and chicken selections.  It was a high energy dining experience, fun to try different meats and then do a repeat on your favorite.  We will definitely be back again.<br/><br/>We had a party of 9 and the table size was too tight - wish our table had been better arranged to fit our group.  Noise level was high, so just something to consider based on your dining plans/dynamics.  Service was very good.  Drink prices a bit steep, but offsets the fair pricing for the salad bar, meats, side dishes etc. - good value for the experience overall.",4," December 19, 2015"
1652,The lamb and creme brulle alone are worth the trip,5," December 19, 2015"
1653,I heard good things about this restaurant but since it is an all you can eat restaurant the server was very pushy to clear our plates. We are not fast eaters especially when I am eating with 2 seniors and a toddler. 30 minutes into my salad and cold appetizers the server came around to clear our plates to eat the main course. We were only able to try 5 items that came around. The server came around 3 times to take our plate fork and knife away. I feel like we were rushed to eat. We were not satisfied with the service at all. But once they clear of the table and we ordered dessert it took forever for the dessert and check to come by. I could of use this time to enjoy more steak and sirloin. And the server charged us drinks that we did not have. Please make sure you check you bill twice.,3," December 19, 2015"
1654,"The food was phenomenal and the ambiance the restaurant was great.  Our server was fine, but it seemed like management understaffed the meat runners the night we were there giving us a less than desired experience, especially me, because I was hosting 3 business colleagues.",2," December 15, 2015"
1655,My lunch at Fogo de Chao was an incredible experience. The variety of different cuts of meats coming around seemed too good to be true. This is an incredible restaurant and the price is surprisingly reasonable for what it is. I'll go for dinner next time and have some red wine with my meal.,5," December 15, 2015"
1656,This restaurant is a carnivores delight! A variety of perfectly cooked meat and poultry...available in whatever quantities you want on the buffet.,4," December 12, 2015"
1657,"I'm Brazilian.. The best barbecue I've ever eaten.  I'll be back, sure. Thank you!",5," December 11, 2015"
1658,"The challenge is that I go to the Fogo in Austin Texas and I found myself comparing the two. The one in Texas feels like an upscale dining experience. Boston's location was very loud and a waiting line around the salad bar. I brought my husband to Fogo for the fist time after him hearing about all of my incredible experiences in Texas and I believe he was not as impressed as he expected to be. The service in Texas was that of a team, I never have to ask for a clean plate or ask for a refill on my drink. Unfortunately the Boston location was the compete opposite. I found myself waiting for my plates to be changed out as well as having to wait to get a drink.",3," December 5, 2015"
1659,"I always enjoy Fogo de Chao, the favorite of meat is awesome and always tasty. It can get really loud depending where you end up sitting. I really like variety of foods with the exception of the mashed potatoes, they seem like instant mash.",4," December 5, 2015"
1660,"Food was great and service was great.  However, if I am going to spend $150 for 2 people for dinner I think I would prefer a steakhouse where I am chosing the meat I want, cooked the way I want it.  With that being said, this is fun for a special event and to try different meat!",4," December 5, 2015"
1661,Really nice time with my parents.  All the staff were kind and extremely polite!  Food was great,5," November 26, 2015"
1662,All the food is soooo good. I ate like 6 pounds of beef,5," November 26, 2015"
1663,Really enjoyed the restaurant's atmosphere. It was an excellent choice for an alternative on the traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Definitely will go back again. I would recommend it highly to anyone that wants to have an experience that's different from the traditional restaurant.,5," November 26, 2015"
1664,"Very good with food allergy, lots of delicious food. Although one minor thing, in the beginning the meat serving speed was a bit fast, even though I knew they weren't trying to rush us, but I don't want to miss any of the new kind of meat they offered for each round of serving, so I have to speed up to catch the speed of serving, and that made my stomach stuffed too quickly.",5," November 26, 2015"
1665,"Location of the restaurant is very desirable, Food was amazing and service was top notch. The only negative thing about this place is its more of a get together place instead of high upscale experience. For instance we were dressed up for fine dining only to realize the three tables beside us were in sweat pants and college t-shirts. It takes a way from the experience and presents itself as a casual place vs what the restaurant strives for.",2," November 22, 2015"
1666,"Brought my girlfriend here to celebrate our anniversary. She moved out of brasil when she was 5 and found the place very nostalgic that it brought her to tears being reminded of everything from her youth and family. Highly recommend this spot. Great food, great service, very happy.",5," November 22, 2015"
1667,"Service was good. Although dinner and drinks are pricey, the food was amazing.",5," November 21, 2015"
1668,"I was recommended to go to this restaurant and it was the BEST recommendation ever! The food was beyond delicious! The servers  ,the wait staff, the hostess, every person that was part of the restaurant staff was friendly , courteous, and went beyond their job duties to make the experience at their place the BEST I have had in many years! Definitely recommending them and coming back for more! Thank you!",5," November 21, 2015"
1669,Great place love coming here,5," November 20, 2015"
1670,"We went to Fogo de Chao with high expectations and we were a little disappointed with the food. We liked the overall concept of eating unlimited meat cut and served at the table. The service was very good. The meats, however, were too salty for our taste. The salad bar was okay. Wine was overpriced compared to the quality of the food and the ambiance.  Overall, we were glad we tried the restaurant, but it probably wouldn't be our first choice next time.",3," November 20, 2015"
1671,"Was having ask and then wait for filet minion and lamb chop <br/><br/>and <br/><br/>How long it took to get our check and then our change. <br/>Our waitress was all over us the entire night asking if we wanted clean plates,water or if we were finished eating when we weren't. Then when we were finished she was nowhere to be found. We waited for so long, my friend asked me ""do you think she went home"" I said ""no, I bet she had been cut and is in the back doing her side work"". We asked a meat server to get her and when she came out, because she had been in the back for so long, I am guessing all of her tables needed something causing us to wait even longer. We waited a good while longer for our change then, which was brought over by a manager who I had seen previously standing and chatting to another wait staff. I understand after a long shift trying to get your side work done so when your last table leaves you can too but, don't neglect your tables.",4," November 18, 2015"
1672,"It had an amazing food, atmosphere, and service.  I will definitely come here again with my friends.",5," November 15, 2015"
1673,"I had a great time there. I visited different types of Brazilian steakhouses I always love the way they serve meat. <br/>The Food was delicious, the atmosphere was great.<br/>1. Our server was not experienced enough. 2. We were 15 and she was the only server at our table.  I had to call her many times to ask about different things  we needed.<br/>3. One of the meat server dropped the meat  sauce on my hand and my white dress and didn't even acknowledge it.",4," November 14, 2015"
1674,"I've eaten at Texas de Brazil in Dallas, Washington DC, Chicago, Orlando and Atlanta. This is the first time I've been to the one in Boston and it met the expectations we've come to expect at Fogo.<br/><br/>I felt like writing this particular review because I'm continually impressed how consistent the quality is with Fogo de Chao around the country. That truly is a mark of good management! <br/><br/>The meat came quickly. The service was actually slightly better than the other locations. <br/><br/>My one complaint was that one of the servers didn't know the proper way to cook picahna and they were more stingy with the filet mignon than the others --- although they're all pretty stingy --- usually you'll see chicken 5 times before you see it. I had to ask for it and it still didn't arrive until the server came back to check on me. The fact that the server checked to make sure I got my filet made all the difference in the world.<br/><br/>We ordered drinks and as usual they weren't watered down.",4," November 14, 2015"
1675,Loved our special evening at Fogo!,4," November 11, 2015"
1676,Meatlovers heaven,5," November 7, 2015"
1677,"This is a great place to go to if you've never been and want a kitchy eating experience.  It's fun to be able to get unlimited meat and salad bar, just be sure to understand that it is all pretty mediocre.  We went for a birthday and they give free dessert if you celebrate there which is awesome!",2," November 7, 2015"
1678,"The services was great, meat very salty, not many options on Brazilian food in the buffet and absolutely expansive. I paid $477+18% of gratitud for a 3 couples and the worst...the 3 ladies didn't eat a lot of meat. So if you are not a big meat eater, is not worth.",3," November 7, 2015"
1679,Not nearly enough gauchos serving meat.  Uncharacteristically poor service for this place.,2," November 7, 2015"
1680,I was amped up for this all day! The food was a huge let down.,3," November 7, 2015"
1681,"This is a great restaurant to go to with a group. More than dining, it is an experience. Two things to know - definitely go hungry and expecting to eat lots of food. And take breaks! You get this card you flip from green to red - green means they will keep coming around offering you all these amazing delicious meats. Red means you are taking a break - to eat the amazing meats! This is all you can eat so pace yourself!  Great food, great service and great fun.",5," November 7, 2015"
1682,Excellent service throughout!,5," November 6, 2015"

1684,"First discovered Fogo in Atlanta on business, the one in Boston is awesome as well.   The food is great, the salad bar is super good, and the service is the best.    You are well taken care of while you are there, you will not be disappointed.",5," November 6, 2015"
1685,"I really love that restaurant , they provide nice food and service to everyone in the restaurant",5," November 6, 2015"

1688,Food was awesome and service was better!  This restaurant is coming to Toronto in 2016 they told me in Boston ...Cant wait!,4," October 28, 2015"
1689,"As usual this Fogo de Chao delivers great food, especially for meat lovers.  There is a great salad / antipasto bar for the non-meat eaters, but the constant parade of meat flying by would make most vegetarians a bit squeamish. For the carnivores... its an uninterrupted supply of succulent, well-Pseasoned meat of most varieties you can imagine.  If you've eaten at this chain, you know what I mean.  If you haven't, highly recommended for carnivores  !  You won't be disappointed.",5," October 24, 2015"

1692,We had a large group. There was 12 of us eating and drinking. Although the food was amazing I felt like they didn't come around a lot. I have been to Fogo all across the country. Normally when you flip the circle to green they are all over you. In our case you had to wait... sometimes 15-20 min. Rare indeed for Fogo.<br/><br/>Overall it's an amazing place. We still had a great time... just wished the service was a little peppier and up to normal Fogo standards.,3," October 17, 2015"
1693,"Certainly not a value play, but has a nice atmosphere, good selection of food and responsive service.<br/>Compared to my last visit about 6-9 months ago, the meats selection seems more limited, and some types were notably drier and less flavorful, especially bacon-wrapped filet mignon.<br/>Salad bar could use more fresh vegies, but othewise was great as always.",4," October 17, 2015"
1694,My entire party was very pleased with entire experience,4," October 17, 2015"
1695,It tends to get noisy on Thursdays-Sundays for dinner.,4," October 16, 2015"
1696,"Salad bar was great, rest of the food was sub par at best.  Over salted and not great cuts of meat.",2," October 16, 2015"

1698,"Definitely a place to visit on an empty stomach if you want to be able to try a lot of things! A fun, interactive way to dine. A little pricey, but you are paying for the experience.",3," October 13, 2015"
1699,"Good service, very accommodating. Food is good quality and plentiful. Not sure what else you could ask for?",5," October 10, 2015"
1700,The restaurante is overrated. The food is too expensive and not worth. The restaurante is full of students; looks like a college dining!!! There are kids running around!! Too much noise. For the price that I paid I would expect better service and exclusivity.,2," October 10, 2015"
1701,"Everything was absolutely amazing. The service was 5 class and the food was delicious. The best brazilian steakhouse I've ever been too. The food is fresh with so much variety. Our waiter was very attentive and welcoming. Thank you so much, for helping us celebrate our 3 year anniversary. We will be back again.",5," October 9, 2015"
1702,"Fogo de Chao in Boston is wonderful, an abundance of food which just keeps coming.  The market table is plentyful with an array of foods. The wait staff and table servers are fantastic and the management made plenty of appearances to make sure that everyone was well taken care of!",5," October 9, 2015"
1703,"I have been to other locations so I knew the food would be delicious but the service was unbelievable. They were always there to greet you when getting back to your seat, refilling water, bringing the meat the way you wanted it, and just overall friendly staff. It was a great atmosphere with superb food, but the service brought the overall experience to a 10!",5," October 9, 2015"
1704,"Vine was excellent, quality of food (meat) was very good except lamb chops.",5," October 9, 2015"
1705,We compared it with the original in Brasil where we have been two times and it comes close.<br/>Except the number of meat cuts where more in Brasil as we felt.All in all again a good place to stay for special occasion. Service was very good.,5," October 8, 2015"
1706,The service was one of the best experiences I have ever had. The staff was awesome and they truly make the dinner special. The food was amazing also and we were completely stuffed when we left. The filet mignon was absolutely decadent.,5," October 4, 2015"
1707,"Great place to eat for meat lovers. If you eat a lot of meat, the 51 bucks they charge just for the food are worth it.",4," October 3, 2015"
1708,"This place just wasn't not for me. <br/><br/>I'll elaborate. I am a craft beer guy. When I asked what they have on draft for beers? They dont have a draft beer system. Fine. What do you have in bottles? Sam, Harpoon, and all the typical light beers I hate.  If I have meat, I need a good beer to wash it down. Most men do. Pass. <br/><br/>The service? Attentive in waves. You would get 3 servers asking you if you are alright all at once, and then you wouldn't see them again for 10 minutes at least. I needed to ask for many of the meats I wanted, and their explanation of the dining process was spoken at a rate of speech I just couldn't follow. Also, men thundering past me at TOP SPEED WITH SHARP CARVING KNIVES doesn't make for a relaxing dinner - just cause for caution. <br/><br/>The food: The meat was cooked fine. Rare, medium rare, medium, well-done - all represented. However, the lamb was greasy and gamy, and their chicken was only so-so. It's an incredibly- rare day when I say ""No, I don't want their filet mignon wrapped in bacon. I'm done."" <br/><br/>Their so called ""International Buffet"" seemed more like a suped-up Golden Corral experience with more charcuterie to make it more exotic. Not as advertised. All set.  <br/><br/>Finally, the price. $52 per person? And the dessert is not complimentary (as at many fixed menu dinners)? Wouldn't recommend it. Couldn't.<br/><br/>Overall, if money is no object to you, you LOVE wine and fancy stiff drinks, and you want an ""upscale"" experience you can go to in jeans, I would say that Fogo is for you. For me, if I want a nice evening with my wife on her birthday, wearing a collared shirt, I'll stick with a real steakhouse instead.",3," October 3, 2015"
1709,"It was good, nice environment. However disappointed had to paid extra for gizzards, I thought it was a buffet.",4," October 2, 2015"
1710,Excellent service Abd food <br/>Pricey if u are not a big eater,4," October 1, 2015"
1711,The salad bar is excellent. The sides are delicious. The meats are hard to resist.,4," September 27, 2015"
1712,This was our third visit to Fogo de Chao.  The food is always great and the service is reliably good.  Not having to wait and order food makes it easy because you can eat as much or as little as you want and is great for a larger group.,5," September 27, 2015"
1713,"This is NOT Texas de Brazil, but it is a close second.  Everything was very good, just not quite up to the leader in this food category.  The meats were good, but the servers disappeared for long periods of time leaving us to sit by having the sides get cold.  Our waiter was very attentive and tried to track the servers down at times, but it was a bit frustrating as that has never happened at Texas de Brazil so we weren't expecting it here for the price tag.  Also of note, the reception from the hostess was blah and uninterested as was from everyone at that stand.  You should be welcomed into a restaurant no matter how busy it is!",4," September 26, 2015"
1714,The food was flavorful and diverse. I loved that there were different preparations of the same meat.  The dining experience itself is also unique and efficient. Glad we went!,4," September 26, 2015"
1715,Unique ambiance and steakhouse! Delicious!,5," September 25, 2015"
1716,The food at Fogo de Chao was excellent.  The wait staff was attentive and helpful in every way.  The lighting and atmosphere was great.  As the food started coming out it was evident this was a fantastic restaurant.  You could eat as much as you wished and there seemed to always be a new meat type to sample.,5," September 21, 2015"
1717,We have been to several Brazilian steak houses including other Fogo De Cao's<br/>This one had the best quality yet,5," September 20, 2015"
1718,"This is the third restaurant in this chain we'be been to, and they are reliably tasty, with a great focus on the veg with their Market Table. I've opted for the Market Table only on more than one occasion. <br/><br/>The meat is absolutely marvelous. The staff are delightful. And if you're not interested in alcohol, let me recommend the limeade, which is house made and delish. <br/><br/>Can you tell we like this place? This is the loudest of the restaurants we've been to, so be warned if you've been to other locations. But it's still great!",5," September 19, 2015"
1719,"We had an awesome dinner. The market table was more than just a regular salad bar...it was amazing. But, I wouldn't recommend filling up on it...same room for the main course of meats. They bring so many different types of meat and they are outstanding. I got medium and my mom asked for well and they brought steak out just for her...we had a blast. And, the cake was outstanding.",5," September 19, 2015"
1720,omg I love this place. dont pass up the picahana or bottom round. also love the papaya creme with creme de cassis for desert!,5," September 19, 2015"
1721,Fantastic ambiance and service. Food was really great. My waiter was out of this world - super attentive yet not overwhelming. I would recommend this place to everyone. It was better than my first experience in Philadelphia.,5," September 19, 2015"
1722,Everything is first rate and there is never ending good food to eat. Come hungry.,5," September 19, 2015"
1723,"My experience was miserable and romantic.bit was my first time so the beginning was awkward cause I didn't know how it worked, but the employees work as a team to make you feel noticed. Love the fact that everyone checked on you instead of having to wait on a specific waiter. Once we got into the grove of things and grabbed sides from the buffet and had the meat served, the enjoyment started. Also,  I was celebrating an anniversary and they sure did surprise me at the end with a beautifully decorated cheese cake. Thumbs up !!",5," September 18, 2015"
1724,Food was delicious and the service was great,5," September 18, 2015"
1725,"Incredible experience. Waitress was super attentive, as were all the Passadores. Food was top notch, the flavors incredible. We celebrated our 11 year anniversary on a Thursday night and the place was pretty packed even then. Goes to show what a good restaurant can do.",5," September 17, 2015"
1726,"Visited other Fogos in two other cities and were excited to find one in Boston. The ambiance is wonderful and lively. At first things went well with the beginning part of the meal - the salad bar, which has all the fixings of a traditional salad bar but with a large portion of Brazilian delights. Half way through the salad course a waiter with a large skewer broke protocol and tried to slice meat onto our salad plates. This happened twice. Then we started to get the impression that they wanted us to move along as another waitress brought over sides for the meat course. (We didn't flip our little card over yet and they were already preparing for the next course while we were still eating our salad). The meat course was outstanding - the meats were cooked to perfection and not dry at all, including the chicken which has a tendency to taste like the Sahara after a while.  The manager took us by surprise as he was the manager from another restaurant that we went to. He was great and it was great to see him. Aside of feeling rushed as the staff tried to maneuver the courses around this place is wonderful. If you don't mind shelling out $16.00 for a caipirinia I would suggest ordering wine or water - though the caipirinia was very tasty! The manager was made aware of the pace of the servers and he made the appropriate adjustment and we were able to fully enjoy the great food this place puts out. Highly recommend to anyone especially those who have never gone to a Brazilian Steakhouse called a Churrascoria!",4," September 16, 2015"
1727,"This is a Brazilian steakhouse at its finest for quality of food served. The meat is brought around to you on sticks, and it is succulent, delicious, high quality, and lots of it.  There's also an all-you-can-eat salad buffet that goes along with the meats, also at a particularly high quality, especially for a buffet. It is hard to judge the service harshly, since there are so many people constantly coming to your table to offer you more meat, but when it's slow (at the beginning of our meal) you are repeatedly asked if you want a drink or if things are okay, even if someone just left your table, and when it's crowded (at the end of our meal), the waiters get distracted and you can get lost in the shuffle (Despite ordering a drink when I was asked if I wanted another, I never received it and eventually cancelled the order to leave at the end of the evening. It also took a while to get our check). In addition, watch out where you sit - I was the lucky one at our table and was seated on the side of the table too close to another one. When the neighboring table had people seated at it, I repeatedly got rammed into by servers and waiters trying to get by - some of which apologized, but never did anything about the recurring issue. Overall, the food is definitely worth it, but at the price you're paying, you would hope that it doesn't come along with some of the annoyances.",4," September 16, 2015"
1728,"The food was good quality, the buffet salad bar was lovely and generous, and the 'gauchos' walking around with spears of meat were interesting, but for me, it was too much meat meat meat.  The side dishes were also interesting, though the mashed potatoes were overcooked.  I did like the polenta.  Meat is what they do, so my fault, really.  And somehow, for two people, and two drinks, with tip I walked away about $160.00 poorer.",3," September 14, 2015"
1729,"Excellent meat selection, salad bar, specialty cocktails and wine list",5," September 14, 2015"
1730,"Great service, great food selection &amp; great wine list.",5," September 12, 2015"
1731,"Came here with my gf. 80% of the meats were incredibly salty. The variety of meat available was quite limited. The only caramelized pineapple they had costed extra in the dessert the menu :( despite the actual food, the environment of the restaurant was quite spacious, filled with kind staff and is family friendly. Decent but not fantastic. Will be exploring alternative Brazilian steakhouses",3," September 12, 2015"
1732,"I never had so much awesome meat dishes in one place. Fogo is great for group lunches, especially friends, and for meet lovers! This place is a meat lovers dream!!! The service and food is simply awesome!",5," September 12, 2015"
1733,"The good:  this is a meatpoluza. Strip steak, eye, tenderloin, pork, sausages, and my favorite, parm encrusted pork loin all served with a moments notice from the 20 plus servers on the floor. Excellent wine list, expansive salad bar. <br/><br/>The bad:  Friday at 7:30 pm was a zoo and peak serving. Noise was high and it was crowded. The serving felt rushed to turn the table. Mixed drinks are pricey. <br/><br/>Overall:  fun experience, make the dinner flow at your pace, not the servers.",4," September 11, 2015"
1734,"Absolutely delicious!  I don't have one bad thing to say about the food or service. The price is high but if you are a big eater, you definitely  get your money's worth.  I was surprised at the number of young children at such an expensive and upscale restaurant.  Overall, we can't wait to go back!",4," September 5, 2015"
1735,Incredible service and amazing food! The salad bar has great options and the meat never ends.,5," September 4, 2015"
1736,Not a good experience and still waiting for a better impression....,1," September 3, 2015"
1737,Great night. All the meat was cooked to perfection. All the servers were polite and helpful.,4," September 2, 2015"
1738,"I've been to a churrascaria before; this one is the largest I've ever seen.  In spite of the size, the service is friendly and personable.  Lots of food--an overwhelmingly large salad bar with the option of hot sides as well.  Many different kinds of meat prepared in different ways. Some were very tasty; others a little dry.  It's fun to try to try everything, but unless you're very hungry, you probably won't be able to do it.  A great dining experience.",4," September 2, 2015"
1739,"My boyfriend and I both just got new jobs - so we treated ourselves to a nice night out in celebration. We had both never done a Brazilian steakhouse - we fasted almost all day in preparation! The food was great, the service was awesome. The appetizers/salad bar alone were enough to fill you up! The house steak was by far our favorite.",4," August 31, 2015"
1740,Amazing food and a wonderful server. Never had to ask for anything as they were always there.,5," August 31, 2015"
1741,"My boyfriend and I went to fogo on a Saturday night for his birthday. We loved it! It seemed to be a fancier place, but people were very casually dressed...ie baseball caps, jerseys, shorts...typical tourist wear. <br/><br/>The wait staff was very nice and welcoming. <br/><br/>The food was AMAZING! From the salad bar, to the meat that was seemingly prepared for the gods...perfection. <br/><br/>As we were paying the bill, the waiter offered us a coupon for birthdays..I excitedly mentioned we were celebrating one tonight, and he came back with a candle lit flan with Happy Birthday written in chocolate! Just a great way to end the already awesome experience!",5," August 29, 2015"
1742,"Food was decent, great salad bar, but overcooked meat, not romantic, seems like a hotel. Very nice service though.",2," August 28, 2015"
1743,"We went to Fogo de Chao for restaurant week.  First time for us.  Some of the meat was excellent.  Some was not (tough).  Great place for Restaurant Week, overpriced for regular menu in my opinion.  (I recognized many so-so bottles of wine on their wine list that go for $7 at your local store selling for $14 a glass).  But definite a nice experience and a change of pace.   Staff was unbelievably attentive.",4," August 28, 2015"
1744,"The food was out of this world, and the service was fantastic.",5," August 28, 2015"
1745,"Such a unique experience with the buffet available &amp; having servers doing their rounds of different meats on skewers. Thought it was quite different &amp; obviously stands out. Not your typical restaurant. We were given one 2-sided colored card where when where one color indicated you would like the meat servers to come to  your table &amp; the other color meant ""please do not serve me anymore meat.""<br/><br/>Just thought it was all great &amp; we loved the buffet. SO MANY CHOICES &amp; just an elegant setting.",5," August 27, 2015"
1746,"Our  first  experience at Fogo was  during  Restaurant  Week, I  did not  have  high  expectations because of  the  usual high volume of  diners, but  was pleasantly surprised,  Excellent  all around. Highly Recommend it.",5," August 27, 2015"
1747,Thank you Fogo! The meat is fantastic and the salad bar is incomparable! Service is always stellar!,5," August 27, 2015"

1749,"Loved Fogo de Chao.  I came here during restaurant week, so got a good deal (minus a few meat options but I was still 150% satisfied).  The waiters are SO attentive and come to your table constantly with new meat options, pending your chip is turned over to (Green means GO!).  The salad bar was AMAZING with so many options you could fill up on that alone.  The sides were delicious as well, but definitely not the stars when they are compared to meat options such as bacon wrapped chicken and pork ribs.  Will for sure go back, most likely for a special occasion as it is a bit pricey (but well worth it).",5," August 26, 2015"
1750,"Claudia was the best super friendly, however I do think there should have been more staff that night as they all seems to be literally running around to serve everyone.  Overall the place is excellente and the staff is very friendly.",5," August 26, 2015"
1751,It's been my favorite restaurant.  I was not disappointed this time again.,5," August 26, 2015"
1752,"It was a mixed bag yesterday. First, the bartender made the the wrong drink. We had to explain what was missing and sent it back. Then, one of the wait staff was misinforming us about the difference between restaurant week menu and the regular menu.  It was  obivously that he wanted to discourage us and steer us away from the Restaurant  Week menu. Also, the fresh fruit at the salad bar was quite empty and it was not refilled.  Finally, the overall service was  slow and spotty. Even though the food in whole was good, but we were slightly disappointed that the service was lackluster, hence, our dining experience was not the best.",3," August 25, 2015"
1753,"Great food at Fogo De Chau, meat that melts in your mouth marinated to perfection, and a stunning array of choices. The salad bar is also top notch, don't be fooled it's not just salad. Only thing you have to watch here is your wallet.",4," August 25, 2015"
1754,I went with a friend for Restaurant Week and our server was amazing! He even gave me free dessert off the menu because it was my birthday. Everyone was attentive and professional.,5," August 25, 2015"
1755,"I had heard of but had never been to your restaurant before, and now am quite upset that I have been missing out! What a great time I had with my parents and family. Everything was wonderful and everyone really enjoyed themselves. Your staff was really fun to watch as they entertained us with their smooth actions delivering meats to the tables. Kudos to your great staff and the delicious food! We will all be back again to repeat this wonderful dinner. Thank you for living up to your reputation! <br/><br/>There was something for everyone to pick from. My parents, being a little on the elderly side, no longer eat as much meat as they used to and were very happy choosing from your Market Table. My niece came because she had heard about your caramelized bananas and my son couldn't wait to try your restaurant for the whole experience! My husband tried a sample of all your steaks and absolutely raved about how wonderful the lamb was. So all around, dinner was a success. You know how hard it is to make EVERYONE happy .. Again, thank you",5," August 25, 2015"
1756,"This is a very good restaurant in every way: the setting, the service and of course the food. I have to say they did not prepare the lamb very well, too dry, on that I was disappointed, but everything else was really excellent. i highly recommend thsi place.",5," August 25, 2015"

1760,"My wife, and two friends went here on Restaurant Week so we can see what all the fuss is all about.  Well, I have to tell you, we were not disappointed.  The restaurant itself is very roomy inside.  Our waitress was very attentive, and informative............she explained how the whole concept worked.  The salad bar is enormous!!  Everything you would need in a salad is there, and if I was just there for a big salad, i'd be happy.  Now for the meats........because it was the prefixed menu for Restaurant Week, there were a few meats that we could not get, but that did not matter.  Let me tell you, the sirloin was incredible.  I would have been happy with just that, but the meats kept on coming.  The small chicken was also very good.  The only bad meat, well just a little dry, was the lamb.  All in all, a great experience, and would definitely eat here again.",5," August 23, 2015"
1761,"My boyfriend and I love this place. We have been to this location a couple of times along with the one in Chicago. However, this time we were both disappointed, not in the food, but in the service. <br/><br/>Every time we come, everyone is on top of it, as soon as you need a new plate, they bring it, running low on something, don't even need to ask, its there before you realize it. Water glass never less than 3/4 full. However, this past experience we had to ask for different things several times before we would get it. Our water glasses were empty, and I felt like it was a lot of waiting. There seemed to be a bit of chaos. Since we come often enough, we know what to expect and overall it was a bit disappointing. We still enjoyed our time as we were celebrating our anniversary, and I am sure we will be back, but I hope that the service is better next time.<br/><br/>Also, I am not sure of the correct name; however, the gentlemen that bring around the various types of chicken/pork/steak, were very good, they came around often and there was always steak on my plate, no complaints there. This part of the service was good.",3," August 23, 2015"
1762,Most of the meats were delicious.  And the service was excellent.  Very attentive.,5," August 23, 2015"
1763,"The food is good though expensive. You do get what you pay for and its outstanding. Since we went during Restaurant Week, the meat selection was limited. What was offered was good steak and lots of drumsticks. Outstanding flavors.",5," August 23, 2015"
1764,Second trip in Boston. Awesome food and service. Drink glass never empty. Variety of meats phenomenal. Preparation fantastic. If you are disappointed I would be shocked. Even salad bar is over the top. Go hungry or that will be your only disappointment. So many meats so flavorful!! And all of the staff couldn't have been more eager to please. So enjoyable!!,5," August 23, 2015"
1765,"I went here with my family and we all have different tastes and all were very happy with our evening.  The salad bar was great -- I loved getting watermelon and papaya slices to eat with my meat, it was really refreshing.  I also loved the fresh mozzarella which I paired with tomato slices and drizzled with some really nice balsamic.  Additionally, we were served the Brazilian cheese bread (incredible), plantains (went perfectly with the rest of the meal), and some wonderfully seasoned mashed potatoes.  The meat was really well prepared and it was great to be able to choose what I wanted to eat and then get seconds (and thirds) after!  The waitstaff are extremely responsive and friendly.  The desserts were good (I had key lime pie), but nothing special.  This is probably the only thing this restaurant could improve upon -- they are good as is, but just didn't blow me away the way everything else did.  Then again, I would go to a Brazilian steakhouse for the meat and accompanying dishes, not for dessert =p",5," August 21, 2015"
1766,"Went during restaurant week with my wife and two kids. Great salad bar; unlimited steak, lamb, pork and chicken; and great desserts.<br/>Go hungry and enjoy. Service was great, water glasses were kept full.",5," August 21, 2015"
1767,"I have been to this restaurant many times in the past, but this was the first time during the restaurant week. They have a different and very poor menu for the restaurant week which is not worth $38 dinner price tag. The service was horrible and the servant became very not intrested to serve us when she knew will go for the restaurant week menu. At the end, she came and put the bill on the table without asking if we need something else. Very disappointed, and definitely will think twice before going there again.",2," August 21, 2015"
1768,"I have been to Fogo de Chao in Boston for a few times. I love the unlimited supply of food, especially different kinds of grilled meat. I love waiters come to you to serve meat and can offer exactly what I want. The dinner price is usually quite high, but this time it participated in the Boston Restaurant Week,  and it was only $38 per person for dinner. There were a few kinds of meat we were not able to get, but it did not matter that much. My friends and I had a great meal here as usual. I would certainly recommend friends to go there for lunch. It would be awesome if the dinner price could be lower.",5," August 21, 2015"
1769,It was delicious food! Love the seasoning! The service was good but the people bringing the meats made me feel rushed with eating everything on my plate.,5," August 20, 2015"

1771,My friends and I went to Fogo de Chao in Back Bay (Boston) during restaurant week.  We had a nice dinner.  The service was good (didn't rush us) and we enjoyed ourselves.  For a chain Brazilian Steakhouse it was good.  I'd go again for lunch as I'm not convinced the price for dinner is worth it unless you have a huge appetite.,4," August 19, 2015"

1775,"I had a reservation for 12 this past Sunday for the Restaurant Week. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and looking forward to very nice evening out. The experience started off great, host staff were friendly and sat us promptly at our table.  Our server greeted the table quickly and explain the menu to all guests.  After ordering our beverages we were off to the market table,  and from this point our experience went down hill. Once we came back from the market table we had a long gap in getting our selection of meats. We waited on average 10 minutes between meats coming to the table, and most of the time the meat was cold, or not to prefer temperature. We asked the waiter about the service and he explained that they are waiting for the kitchen staff to give more meats to bring out.  At one point the entire restaurant experience a large gap in service.  We decided that we had enough waiting and since we could not get service here it was time to leave. Expect for the 4 diners who were on a veggie and fruit diet the rest of the party left hungry including my wife.  We end up going to Midwest grill for half the price gave great service, and for the first time in my life I left a buffet hungry.  We spent almost $800 on dinner only to leave hungry. The food from the market table was on point,  but the majority of the meats we ate was cold and tough.  Highly disappointed.",1," August 16, 2015"
1776,"We had reservations here for restaurant week August 16th 2015. I called because we would be running a little late, about 10 minutes. The woman on the phone was slightly rude saying she wouldn't hold the reservation if we were past the ten minutes. This was somewhat understandable as I have worked in restaurants. However when we arrived my husband went in to let them know we were there as I was getting my son from the car right outside. The man snapped at my husband and refused to acknowledge us until he physically saw me. He was so unfriendly that my husband left and we decided we didn't want to waste our money at an establishment that didn't know the first thing about customer service! There are more polite ways to communicate with someone and I don't understand how they think that attitude attracts business. Very disappointed!",1," August 16, 2015"
1777,I always try to hit Fogo de Gao when I am in a city that has one. I really like the combination of meats and salads. This location was unique in that there was a roaming bar cart that can by and mixed drinks at the table-fun.,5," August 14, 2015"
1778,"The entire staff was polite, engaging, knowledgable and outstanding!",5," August 14, 2015"
1779,"Although the enormous, fresh salad bar would appeal to any picky vegetarian, do not come here for the veggies. Also, although you may be tempted to fill up on these luscious salad bar treats (both raw and prepared foods), save room for the endless rounds of finely sliced meats at whatever temperature you most appreciate them at. Be picky, or you will quickly find yourself really wanting more but having no room to put it. Sample everything, but once you do, you will realize that the house specialty, picanha, is the way to go, with or without garlic. You must also wash this down with the traditional caiprinha beverage. This alcohol is strong but doesn't taste so strong, so take warning after knocking back 2-3 of them. This restaurant should not be a regular on anyone's list, as one meal is enough red meat for a life time, but I find that I come back way more often than I should. The staff are friendly and helpful and the food is out of this northern hemisphere!",5," August 13, 2015"

This place should be the model for customer service in all places of business.  The food is also noteworthy!  Very tasty side dishes and flavorful meats.  Even my picky two year old enjoyed the food  (chicken, beans and rice are her favorites).  One note, if you plan to valet park, get there around 5ish.  We got there at 4:30 when they open and valet parking was not available at that time.  We will be back for sure---My birthday is coming up (smile)!",5," August 1, 2015"

1786,"The variety of meats and salad items were excellent. The meats were a bit too salty during this visit. Even the cheese bread that is served at the beginning of the meal was too salty. Desserts are not included. For the $55 charged per person, the restaurant should consider sending a free dessert per two people.",4," July 31, 2015"
1787,"Quality of meat nothing like the one in Brazil. There didn't seem to be enough meat servers for the number of patrons. The ""busboys"" were the only folks who really had personality and were attentive. Management looked overly stressed and acted unprofessional yelling at the staff instead of pulling them aside. Extremely disappointing experience, have been to others in the chain and had much better experiences.",2," July 31, 2015"
1788,Meats were too salty. Everything taste the same.  You can't taste the meat at all.,2," July 30, 2015"

The place wasn't clean and the ambience was very cold (over compensating for the hot Boston weather I think)?<br/><br/>Our waiter's service was good; but when it came to order the bill (check) I had to ask a number of times before I actually got up and headed to the counter to get it delivered to me ...<br/><br/>And what a noisy place .. it's as if I were in a wrestling ring :o<br/><br/>Not a place I'd want to go for a good dinner.",2," July 20, 2015"
1790,"First time going here after a few recommendations. This place is fun and energizing. The drinks are good but way overpriced for the signature cocktails. Service is attentive and helpful. But the food has highs and lows. Was a little underwhelmed by the salad bar, maybe because so many people had told me how AMAZING it was before I went. There were a ton of options, but it was very Americanized. Was hoping for more authentic Brazilian. <br/>The meat service was fun and we got to try a lot of things, but again, had its issues. We were seated really close to where the servers came in and out of the dining room, which meant we consistently were either the first cuts for the meat, or were given what was left after a tour of the room-translation-a lot of heels and endcaps, dry and way over cooked. The server would ask me how I like my beef, I'd reply rare, he'd saw off a dry, gray endcap and go, 'here you go!'  Why even ask? <br/>My summary-it's a fun experience, they serve a huge variety of food, and all of it ranges from ok to pretty good.  But for the price, I'd rather have a meal where I get a more limited selection, done spectacularly. Dinner for two, two drinks, bottle of sparkling water, $180.",4," July 19, 2015"
1791,I have been here a couple of times with friends and family- and kids sometimes. There's no replica to this place. The steak is always amaaazing. Make sure you don't eat alot from the food bar buffet before the steak startd runing. Great for date nights.,5," July 17, 2015"
1792,Outstanding experience of so many delicious cuts of meat. You will savor each dish ! It's like going to the best desert table  -only it is the  meatitarian version!  The sirloin cuts are fantastic!  Service is outstanding! I live in Houston and will surely have a few meals at the restaurant located there.,5," July 16, 2015"
1793,Excellent steaks are served at this Brazilian steakhouse. Nice location and not too busy when we were there.,5," July 16, 2015"
1794,This was my second visit. The salad/food bar is amazing in between personal table side service of the meats. I enjoy going here for special occasions. I saw many groups but also couples. I think it's perfect for both. The food was extremely flavorful and the variety is expansive.,5," July 11, 2015"
1795,"I've been to Fogo at least half a dozen times and it's always great. It's paradise for meat-lovers, with different cuts and types of meat being served non-stop. The salad buffet, the fried bananas, and most of all the warm cheese bread may play supporting roles here but they are awesome nonetheless. Great place for big families. A sure hit.",5," July 10, 2015"
1796,"If you are looking to go to Fogo de Chao, you know exactly why you are going. The hype around the meat, salad bar, and drinks is no hype.",5," July 6, 2015"
1797,"I took my husband here for a birthday lunch and we were both thrilled with the experience! The food was fabulous, the service was attentive and pleasant without being too all-up-in-your-space, and the restaurant was rather quiet so we could comfortably talk and have some privacy. Would definitely go here again, worth every penny!",5," July 5, 2015"
1798,"There are so many choices and most of it is quite tasty.  The filet, sirloin and carved lamb were the best.  The lamb chops were the only disapointment.  Our main server was ok... she argued with me that I had ordered the wrong beverage when I told her that the wrong soda was brought to our table.  That was a turn off.  And one of the servers who came around with the meat skewers was quite imposing and I was almost afraid to say that I wanted some.  But, overall it was a good dining experience and we will return for another dinner.",4," July 4, 2015"
1799,"Pay attention!  4 times charged for ""meat"" when I only eat the salad bar.  Is this really a mistake??",4," July 3, 2015"
1800,"My husband  just received a new job, so we chose Fogo to celebrate it.  At first the place was quite at 12:30pm. Then it  filled with tourist and others at lunch time, I understand that  it was the 4th of July weekend.  The service and food was wonderful.  Unfortunately,  there were a lot of children with parents that didn't keep them in line, screaming and crying. We didn't complain but it did ruin our special time to celebrate at a high class restaurant. Food as always is fantastic, even the diverse  salad bar.<br/>Next time I will know better and visit this establishment at a much later time.",5," July 3, 2015"
1801,Really lovely meal<br/> Helpful and friendly staff. Meat to die for! Great salad buffet...if only I had a larger stomach!,5," July 2, 2015"
1802,"This is my second time at this restaurant. The first time it felt like an upscale restaurant with a great atmosphere and great food. This time it felt ""cheesy"" and worn. The food was disappointing. Most of the meat was chewy, fatty or simply lacked flavor. The restaurant is  expensive and not worth the price.",3," June 21, 2015"
1803,"We were looking forward to having great food and a refined ambiance for our special family occasion, and Fogo de Chao certainly did not disappoint. At the same time, there were a few mishaps that would have been more forgivable in a cheaper restaurant. It took us at least 6 to 7 requests for beef ribs to various employees before they finally brought it out. Our waitress was rather impatient and would ask repeatedly if we had already finished eating, and didn't even have the patience to take a picture of us when we asked for it. We were made to think they were offering us a complimentary cocktail for father's day, as it was also very small, and then were charged $12 for it; we basically felt scammed. Overall, we were left wishing the quality of the service matched the quality of the food and the prices we were charged.",4," June 21, 2015"
1804,"A good Brazilian steakhouse.  The salad bar was smaller than we expected.  However, it sufficed.  Our group had a great time.",4," June 20, 2015"
1805,"Took my husband and father to this place. They loved it! My ""only"" thing I have negative to say was the chicken and chicken legs didn't come around as much as the steak,pork and lamb.  It only came 1x to the table. I don't eat meat-just a chicken leg I had so I don't think (for me) it was worth it. My husband and dad def are their share ! Ha ha. We loved(loved)the table side cocktail they made for us. Pineapple infused cocktail. So yummy and worth it! I'd get it again. Can't wait to go back",5," June 20, 2015"

1807,"I ALWAYS ENJOY HAVING MY LUNCH OR DINNER HERE AT FOGO THE FOOD IS VERY FRESH AND COOKED TO THE WAY YOU WANT IT ALSO, GREAT! ATMOSPHERE NICE &amp; CLEAN ALL OF THE STAFF MEMBERS ARE VERY NICE AND THE RESTAURANT IS IN THE MOST FINEST NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE BACK BAY AREA OF BOSTON I WILL RETURN HERE WITH FRIENDS &amp; FAMILY THIS IS MY NUMBER ONE HOT SPOT.",5," June 18, 2015"
1808,One of the best steak houses in Boston! Also fit for vegetarians as the salad bar is huge! Friendly and informative gauchos add to the total experience!,5," June 14, 2015"
1809,"If you like meat, this should be your first choice",5," June 7, 2015"
1810,Everything from the teamwork to the food was spectacular. My husband and I went here for our 1 year anniversary and I am so glad that we did! The hostess was even sweet enough to take a picture of us :),4," June 7, 2015"
1811,Overall was good except that we had to request for beef ribs and lamb chops.,4," June 7, 2015"
1812,As soon as we got there the service was exceptional making us feel right as home. They explained the whole process to us and made everything so easy. The food was outstanding and being Brazilian I was pleasantly surprised. Everything was authentic and very tasty ! I will definitely be coming back !,5," June 7, 2015"
1813,"We got in right as they opened, so it was still quiet. The ambiance and decor were very beautiful, but it did not look like there was a strict dress code (thankfully). I loved that they offered sparkling water. They offered appetizers immediately - the cheese rolls and carmelized bananas were my favorite, I couldn't stop eating them!<br/>There was a good selection of meats and they were served at a steady pace. When it got busier, we did have to wait a little longer on the more popular selections, but they did not hesitate to take requests and send thing specific to you.<br/>The buffet station also had a great and varied selection of dishes to eat with your meats. I was surprised to see smoked salmon and proscuitto. My only complaint is about their sliced bread rolls. They were rather dry and tasted mediocre. I like to have bread and butter with my meals, however, I wouldn't count it against my experience, since there was plenty of other great food.",4," June 7, 2015"
1814,"The main meal was amazing. The steak and sides were fantastic.  <br/>The issue we had was when told about a food allergy, the waitress did not seem to know that one of the ingredients was in the dessert, luckily my husband tasted the cake before I took a full bite.<br/><br/>The manager took responsibility but food allergies are serious and I don't know how much they seemed to understand this. All ingredients should be listed and I hope they fix this, as it could have lead to a very serious issue.",4," June 6, 2015"
1815,The wait staff is very knowledgeable.  I  have always heard of this restaurant and wanted to try it and am glad I did.  Will definitely be back.  The food was excellent.,5," June 6, 2015"
1816,So much fun and so much meat!! Impressive salad bar,4," June 6, 2015"
1817,"The staff is a perfect 10. Kind, conscientious, very sweet and sincere. Friendly<br/>service. They were very considerate of my specific needs. The meats are delicious. I had an hour for my lunch break and I tasted everything with the exception of the lamb. I am excited to go back! <br/>The ambience pics romantic. I love the dark paneling. <br/>The buffet is delightful. Very tasty salads and charcuterie and cheeses... even slices of sweet pineapple, very fortunate if you don't have time for dessert. I must go back for dessert! For the lovely, kind, talented smiling staff, for the delicious foods. <br/><br/>My first experience with a Brazilian steakhouse is WOW!",5," June 4, 2015"
1818,"This was likely the best eating experience we've ever had. I have been to several restaurants in this franchise, and this evening's dinner was phenomenal. Thank you!",5," May 31, 2015"
1819,"Fogo never fails to be be one of the best restaurants in Boston.  Their Management organizes the staff so well that you never need to ask for anything.  Also, the Management takes the time to greet the customers and assure that everyone is enjoying their dining experience.  The Waiter Staff and Food Servers are exceptional.  They never leave a person with out the food that they have requested and cooked to the temperature the customer requests.  We misssed Claudia this weekend because we were in a different area, but the Waiter we had was fine too.<br/>Thank you so much for always being perfect!",5," May 30, 2015"
1820,We dined here for our 30tg wedding anniversary. I found the staff to be engaging and the flooded delicious. The filet mignon especially was beyond delicious. The booze cart is a great idea and so much fun! We plan to come back soon.,5," May 24, 2015"
1821,"I went to Fogo de Chao for my daughters birthday. The service, food, and atmosphere was all excellent.",5," May 23, 2015"
1822,I had an awful experience! Our waitress was rude and not polite at all ! Our drinks were all warm instead of cold! And she took so long to bring them . The guys who were serving the meat a lot of times skiped my table . I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to no one .,2," May 22, 2015"
1823,"You can get a better steak at Cap Grille or Mortons, but the experience is incredible.  Great spot for a celebration.",5," May 20, 2015"
1824,"This is one of the best Brazilian steak houses (Rodozio)<br/><br/>The food and service are just the same you would enjoy at their  Restaurants in Brazil<br/><br/>Great atmosphere, excellent steak and very authentic Caipirinhas",4," May 17, 2015"
1825,Unfortunately the food at this location was not like other Fogo de Chaos.,3," May 15, 2015"
1826,People are great at this location. Food was awesome and fresh. Guys with meats kept coming over and feeding us until we were fuller than wood ticks. Highly recommended place and location.,5," May 12, 2015"
1827,"Well Maintained. Good, Friendly service and excellent  food!",5," May 12, 2015"
1828,"Since the first time I went to Fogo de Chao, I fell in love with the scenery, food, and service. Fifteen times later, I still am crazy about it. The food makes me feel as if I'm back in South America and having asado, and ordering a Guarana is a must with the meal. Though the price may scare some and keep others from coming through the doors, I believe it's worth it considering the many different cuts of meat that circle your table and never stop. Add that with a gournent salad bar and foodies will keep coming back for more. The pan de queso that is brought to your table as soon as you sit down adds to the amazing experience, and that's one thing you will keep asking for more. Servers are always coming around to your table, asking if you need anything at all, and are very accommodating. I have been here many times for birthdays, special occasions, and more often than not, the simple craving for Brazilian churrascaria. I highly recommend this restaurant for any that enjoy meat and don't want to stop eating. Not for those health obsessed and who watch how much they eat. Those people can stick with the salad bar.",5," May 11, 2015"
1829,"A great place to go to with a group of friends.  The atmosphere provides an easy way to enjoy conversation.  The meat was great, and the appetizer bar was good.",5," May 10, 2015"
1830,"It was a Friday night and I was staying at the Westin so we decided to try out Fogo de Chao. I walked up to the counter and asked for a table for 2. The host quickly retorted that it will take 1.5 hours to wait. That's fine I thought, I can wait since I don't have a reservation. No problem. <br/><br/>However, I had a suspicion that there were spaces available and that a 1.5 hour seemed a bit ridiculous. I went online to opentable to search for a reservation. There were several time slots available with the earliest one being a mere 30 minute wait from the time I walked up to the host asking for a table for 2. <br/><br/>So you go from 1.5 hours to 0.5 hour? That seems ludicrous to me. I promptly informed the host that I just booked a reservation for 8:30, and he quickly retorted that ""we're fully committed at 8:30"". What?! I told him that I just booked via opentable and then he said ok I'll switch you over to the reservation list. I would have appreciated if he were more open about having reservations available online rather than having me wait for 1.5 hours. I was furious.<br/><br/>At Fogo, they use green / red cards to denote if you want more food or not. I had my green card up so I could get more of the scrumptious lamb. The host came by, isolated me ONLY, and asked if I needed any special requests from the kitchen. What?! The whole point of the restaurant is to use the green / red card. Why would you single me out? It didn't make any sense. I was fully convinced that he was irritated at me for finding a ""loophole"" around his ridiculous 1.5 hour wait. <br/><br/>The host is disrespectful of his customers and I will not return because of this.",4," May 9, 2015"
1831,"We came following a friend's recommendation. The place was surprisingly full, considering the way too expensive not amazing food. Bad acoustics. Non attractive decor. No prices on the menu. They like to keep that a secret. Makes sense, considering... First you're sent to the buffet, to get yourself full on vegetables and poorly seasoned salads. Then you get never ending meat coming to your table until you beg them to stop. Nice, nothing to write home about. And then comes the check. About 50% more than what I thought it was worth.<br/>Take my advice - go somewhere else!",2," May 9, 2015"
1832,Delicious food as always. Service for drinks can be slow but not bad.,4," May 9, 2015"

1836,Very good restaurant... food and services perfect!!,5," April 26, 2015"
1837,"It was a great restaurant, we were celebrating the Boston Marathon finish  and my 50th Birthday. The food was so good and fresh and plenty of it. The best meat ever the best waitress and really catered to us.<br/><br/>Great wine and my husband and daughter had dessert and said it was awesome. D√©cor was very comfortable and inviting.",5," April 22, 2015"
1838,Make sure everyone eats lots of red meat! Vegetables are buffet style and cold.  Great choice of high end alcohol.,3," April 19, 2015"
1839,"Restaurant you will only go once , unless you want to spend  lots of money . Very expensive !",5," April 19, 2015"
1840,The various meats were excellent and plentiful. It would be nice to see more traditional Brazilian side dishes though. White rice and black beans? So many other great dishes they could add. Besides plain salads. The cheeses were also very good.,4," April 11, 2015"
1841,"Fogo de Chao Boston is as good as the others around the Country.  It is hard not to love this place: Caipirinha's, caramelized bananas, cheese puffs, a wonderful salad buffet, followed by all the meat you can eat. Good service and nice surroudings add to make this a fun dining experience.",4," April 10, 2015"
1842,We went for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the range of selections on the salad bar.  There was so much to choose from that my wife and I did not even get the meat option.  Our kids did get the meat and both enjoyed it very much.,4," April 10, 2015"
1843,"I have been impressed by Fogo every time I've been there. As soon as you arrive the service is impressive. The servers explain the concept of the restaurant to first timers, while repeat customers move right to ordering drinks. The salad bar always has a great selection of quality greens and other assorted dishes. My favorite on the salad bar is the smoked salmon, which I haven't seen in many other restaurants and is a welcome addition. The steaks and various meats brought around by carvers  is always delicious. The meat servers are very attentive to temperature preferences manage to remember preferences throughout service despite visiting many tables. My favorites among the assortment of meats is the ribeye steak and the lamb chops. The dessert menu has a good variety of excellent options, from traditional flan to my favorite, turtle cheesecake. Throughout the meal the service is superb and the staff is very attentive to each diner's needs. Overall, great experience every visit and one of my favorite restaurants. Easy to see why Fogo is an up and coming restaurant chain around the country.",5," April 9, 2015"
1844,love hereÔºÅ,5," April 4, 2015"
1845,"The service is outstanding, the different meats, all delicious! The salad bar has wonderful fresh veggies and a divine basil dressing!",5," April 2, 2015"
1846,"We made a reservation on Open Table for 8 @ 6pm on a Saturday.   We were all travelling close to an hour and we were within 5 mins of our reservation time.  They seated us immediately and the service here is excellent.    The waiters work as a team and could not be more attentive, even when they are all straight out.   The FOOD, the food the meats, the sides, the salad bar,  are way beyond your normal steak house.   16+ cuts of meat delivered to your table, as much as you want.   This is a five star restaurant by my count.   If you don't love it here, your doing it wrong.",5," March 28, 2015"
1847,"I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere here!  If you are a meat lover you will enjoy the various cuts of beef, the chicken and pork.  I don't eat red meat very often but I will say I really enjoyed the first cut of lamb that came around and could not resist trying just about everything that came to the table.  The only turn off for me was the abrupt way some of the meat servers came to the table - one in particular continued to return to our table with the pork sausages although we told him each time no one wanted this item, one put the skewer down so hard it caused things to move on the table.  I also was turned off with the pushing of additional drinks.  We order wine to come when we began our meat servings, however the server brought it over immediately and insisted that it be opened and sampled now although we were still enjoying our before dinner drinks.  I am a one drink person and felt rushed to finish my drink and was ask over and over if I wanted another by the same server.  I really feel this is the way they push the bill up since you are already paying a set price for the meal.  Despite this I would return again since the food was delicious.  We spent much more than we planned but had a great and enjoyable time.",4," March 28, 2015"
1848,"Great food.  Excellent salad bar.  Great for private dinning, or with a group.  Wait staff have always been very friendly and accommodating.",5," March 21, 2015"
1849,"The place is nice with good food and everything. Something I personally did not like that much about the food was that it was more salty than for my taste but beyond that there is a huge variety of options.<br/>However, my comment has to do with the opentable categorization. A place that charges $51.5 per person on an all you can eat meal is by definition not in the $31-$50 category.",4," March 20, 2015"
1850,atmosphere was fast paced  and fun. Food was excellent and staff were very friendly,5," March 20, 2015"
1851,"What a great experience. The staff was so friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The food was of exceptional quality and, of course, quantity. Even the dessert was fabulous. I would caution prospective patrons to watch the wine prices. That took me by surprise!",4," March 20, 2015"
1852,"My friend from Atlanta, GA visited last week and we went to lunch at Fogo with a reservation for 11:30, when they opened. As soon as the server greeted us and asked our preference for bottled or tap water, he bagan to feature some of their Specialty Cocktails, then immediately asked what cocktails we would like. We both said that we would like some time to take a look. We then went up to their salad bar, which was stocked full of fresh salads, smoked salmon and deli meats, just to name a few. Once we returned to our table, our server appeared asking for our cocktail or wine orders. My friend Amanda said she was probably just going to stick with water, in which he replied in a rude way, ""REALLY?! Ok..."" Then asked me. I said I still hadn't really taken a closer look and would like time. He then began to take the beverage menus from the table. We both stopped and said he could leave them as we may be interested a little while later. Not only was it before noon, or that we were out the night before and a bit hungover, but it shouldn't be pushed to order alcoholic beverages or looked down upon when they're not ordered. We could've been sober alcoholics for all he knew. As soon as he left the table, the men serving the pieces of stakes began to come over to our table. The first Brazilian steak server began to ask us which drinks we would like. He told us of one of the special Brazilian cocktails they serve and that back in Brazil this is what they eat steak with. Then he asked, ""Can I tell the bartender to make you one? Or two?"" Like woah, too pushy!! At that point I kind of gave in, very uncomfortably said ""ok?"", but just friend Amanda didn't. He didn't ask for my ID as I look far younger than 40 (23 years old) and immediately another server brought me the drink. I continued to drink water proving that that was my preferred beverage at this time. The steak was great but the pushy service made both my friend and me VERY uncomfortable &amp; unhappy with the experience.",3," March 19, 2015"
1853,"It's an experience..and fun for a group.  Salad bar is amazing..all of the best and freshest ingredients...and then the meat comes..Some cuts are better than others...we preferred the beef cuts, and specifically the ribeye and filet...lamb, pork, ribs, chicken were okay...<br/><br/>Careful not to overdo it!  It is easy to overeat here!",4," March 15, 2015"
1854,"Showing up with 4 of the 6 people in my party and being told we couldn't be seated until the entire party was present was disappointing. Additionally it took way to long to get the server with the filet to come by the table. The explanation was lame- ""filet goes quickly "".  We had another person join our party for a fri k and it took way too long to get her a glass of wine.  Explanation equally lame - hard to find a clean wine glass at 10:00 on a Saturday nighy.",2," March 7, 2015"
1855,"We used to go here every month or so. Lately we are having issues with getting the meat over to the table. They are not refilling the bread like they used to. The last 2 dinners were a disappointment. We may not be going back. We may not have the same selection at Capital Grill, but the service and good are more consistent.",3," March 7, 2015"
1856,"There is a wide selection of meats as Fogo de Chao offers diners the option of indulging in Brazilian rodizio. The selection includes different cuts of steak, pork, and chicken. It is meatlovers heaven! The ambiance in the restaurant is dim lighting which offers a nice backdrop for a date. The drinks are tropical and they do not cut you short on the alcohol.  I would recommend getting a caipirinha which is a Brazilian traditional drink.",4," March 6, 2015"
1857,The cuts of meat are brilliant and the  service staff is very attentive and prompt. I will definitely come back again!,5," March 6, 2015"
1858,"Have been to several of these type restaurants including the ""original"" ones in Sao Paulo and Rio.   It is a tried and true formula but this particular venue was too large and slightly off the mark - not terrible but it all seemed a bit too contrived and the food and service wasn't as good as others.",3," February 28, 2015"
1859,Decided to come here to do something different for my birthday. The multiple servers that served us were all wonderful. Anytime we had a meat request they quickly got someone over to the table. The manager also changed our table away from the door which we greatly appreciated on a busy Saturday. Fun experience all around.,5," February 28, 2015"
1860,"Once you turn your card over from red to green, sit back and buckle up, because you're in for the ride of your life. Some of the best steaks you will ever enjoy just keep coming to your table. It was a blast to say the least. The worst part was the fact that my stomach couldn't hold more. I love this place.<br/><br/>My wife and I went here for our anniversary and I just casually mentioned that when making the reservation. At the end of dinner they brought us a delicious desert that was picture perfect. I didn't want to leave. This was one of my best restaurant experiences in my life!",5," February 28, 2015"
1861,Fun place interesting concept good food if you love meat. A bit to expensive side for what you get.,4," February 26, 2015"
1862,Great salad bar!  The steaks were generally very good as was the lamb and the sausage. The pork chops and chicken were over cooked and dried out.  The pork ribs were not good.  My biggest problem is how they push the cheaper types and cuts of meat.  I had to ask to get any lamb brought to the table.  The wind list is pretty good but mark ups are substantial.  If your craving meat and willing to be a little pushy to get the high end cuts then it's the place to go.,3," February 20, 2015"

1868,"Fogo is definitely a unique restaurant, with it's buffet style meal and personally fresh cut meat at your table. The food was exquisite! The only surprising thing was the price because you don't know it until you get the bill, but regardless it's so worth it.",5," January 24, 2015"
1869,"Everything was good, starting from the drinks made by the bartender. food and buffet good.  The only thing missing for a Brazilian Steakhouse are the organs: no kidney, no heart, no liver ..... a bit disappointed but overall good.<br/>Special thanks to Matthew who was very professional and detail oriented. And I know what I'm talking about, I'm myself waiter in a high end Steakhouse. He speaks a good French which made it even better since I am French.",4," January 18, 2015"

1871,"Unfortunately there was a water leak on January 8 so I was not able to.actually go as they closed for the night. I was really bummed out because I was celebrating a bibirthday with a friend and we were looking forward to going the entire week. Nonetheless I received a voicemail letting me know what happened but I wasn't able to retrieve the message until I was already on my way there for our 6pm reservation. This totally sucked for us but they reached out personally. I have dined there in the past many times at different locations and have had awesome experiences everytime. They go above and beyond to make sure that everyone has an amazing time. I recommend dining here as it will be an experience not easily forgotten. The food is delicious and salad bar is every vegetarians, vegans and/or carnivores dream. Something for everyone!",5," January 8, 2015"

1874,I have now dined at 2 of these restaurants (Chicago and Boston) and I must say that BOTH times I've walked away impressed by the food and the service....even though I was expecting it!,5," January 3, 2015"
1875,"I love the system they have green = give me more meat, red = I'm not ready for more yet! This was a phenomenal experience for my fianc√© and I. We both left stuffed to the gills and would definitely come back for another fun experience!",5," January 2, 2015"
1876,"As usual, being a Brazilian at fogo de ch√£o helps you get the best meat! But to be honest, the experience was a little less exceptional when compared with other FdC restaurants like the one in Philadelphia. The brand was sold to an american corporation and is no longer owned by brazilians apparently. I hope they will keep the same level of quality as fogo de ch√£o in Brazil, which is truly exceptional. I wish there were more meat options like cupim, chicken hearts, as well as all sorts of grilled fish. But don't get me wrong, it is still a very good restaurant, with Brazlian taste. Matou a saudade.",4," January 1, 2015"
1877,"Unique, authentic experience.<br/>Come very hungry.<br/>Pricey so good for special occassions.",4," December 30, 2014"
1878,"Food was very good but too much and expensive.  No options on pricing unless you are a vegetarian, so even if you don't want to eat a lot you have to pay.  Drinks were rediculously expensive - $16.",3," December 27, 2014"
1879,"After our first visit last week we decided that we liked the restaurant a lot and decided to come back. We actually came back a couple of days later and we don't know what happened, but most servers just ran by our table without offering any of the meats they were carrying. Probably driven by the location of our table, but at the end this was a serious downside as tarrying to track down waiters should not be a major activity in any visit to a Brazilian steakhouse.",3," December 27, 2014"
1880,"2nd time to this specific Fogo and it was great all over again. Had a party of 8 (+ a baby) for a birthday dinner on Saturday night and everyone enjoyed every little bit of it. I think I possibly ate about 8 lamb chops to myself. Anyway, the selection of meat was great - any specific cut of meat we wanted they brought out to the table immediately as it was cooked. Salad bar was fresh and constantly refreshed over the course of the night but don't over-do it because there is a lot of meat to be had! They let the 1 year old baby snack on some of our stuff for free which was nice to find out when the bill came. We also got a comped desert for the birthday boy at the end of our meal. The whole party has been to some sort of Brazilian Steakhouse before and said that hands-down this was the best they have ever experienced. Definitely great and accommodating for groups. Service was great to, there are so many people around your table at certain times you cant remember who exactly is the head server for the table but they all did an exceptional job with our requests.",5," December 27, 2014"
1881,Went for birthday,5," December 26, 2014"
1882,"Overall, it was a great spot for group gathering, or meat lovers. The decor was phenomenal, food was great, but just the service was a little bit slow. The waiter/waitress was not attentive, we were asking for additional set of utensils, and waited for about 5 minutes, the waitress has no facial expression whatsoever, and never said a word back when we said ""Thank you"" to her after she brought us the utensil. I consider that as a little rude for customer service.",5," December 24, 2014"
1883,"Great service, per usual. Meat was a bit salty. When asking how you like your meat cooked, go a bit lower than what you normally would ask for - they usually give it to you more cooked than you expect - eg. medium was really a well-done, medium rare was more medium. I usually like a rare plus/medium rare but asked for rare bc what they were giving me was overdone to my taste.",4," December 21, 2014"
1884,"I was introduced to Fogo de Chau in Las Vegas and had a great experience. When a friend of mine came to visit, I decided to see if the Boston restaurant would be as good, and it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>In case you did not know, this Brazilian steakhouse is set up to bring you an endless supply of meats (steak, ribs, sausages, etc.) until you are full and you control when they bring it to you.<br/><br/>First, if you are going on the weekend, try to get a reservation, as I'm told the place books up. However they do accept walk-ins. Just be prepared to have a drink at the bar while you wait.<br/><br/>Fogo has their own wines, so I tried their Malbec and was impressed how good it was. It complemented the constant barrage of meats coming my way (yes, that's a good thing). I made sure to try everything they had and most of it was delicious. I believe I had one piece of filet that was a bit dry, but otherwise it was great. They also had a beverage that was aged rum infused with pineapple. It was smooth and delicious (I wish I remembered the name).<br/><br/>Bonus points for the friendliness of the staff.<br/><br/>ONLY GO IF YOU ARE HUNGRY!!! In my opinion, the experience is wasted if you only go for a few pieces of meat or just have a salad. Oh, they also have a full salad bar, but I would not fill up on that.",5," December 13, 2014"
1885,"Per usual, I left Fogo De Chao Boston feeling pleasantly satisfied.  The service was impeccable with someone at your beck and call ready to ensure an exquisite dining experience.  The meat service was absolutely phenomenal.  The juicy cuts of meat prepared to satisfy everyone's taste and palette was such a delight and impressive to my friends who were foreign to the concept left them wanting more and making Fogo De Chao a new favorite.",5," December 13, 2014"
1886,Makes me want to go again and again! Ive slready told all my friends and family about this olace and thery going aswell.,5," December 13, 2014"
1887,"Although the meat was delicious, the experience was horrible!!!  There were eight of us and we all agree, not worth it and never going back. They tried to seat us in a crowded back corner of the restaurant, we have several larger men in the party, it was way to tight and they were annoyed I asked to have a different table despite the restaurant not being crowded.  The waitress was scarce.  Two of us sat without a dinner plate as the meat servers began to come around and I sat with a green disc in front of me for 3 rounds of meat without ever being asked or served.  I always like to give wait staff the benefit of the doubt but can't here. After enjoying several of the meats, my friend and I wanted to have the salad bar but the waitress had other plans for us - she was clearing the table of all food, plates, silverware, not caring or asking if we were finished and unaffected when I told her I wanted to get the salad bar.  My friend was so uncomfortable that she didn't bother with the salad bar. I still got my greens but had to steal silverware from another table.  At the price you pay and the type of restaurant it is, we were hoping for a nice relaxing dinner.  It was anything but, we felt very rushed and we were all just as happy to leave. <br/>And buyer beware - Either she or the restaurant automatically added the gratuity but never mentioned it - thank God the guys noticed!",2," December 12, 2014"
1888,"I have dined at this restaurant 3 times, 2 of which we encountered problems.  Management takes a very hard line and says that there is nothing that they can do.  This is consistent for management.  The last time there was a discrepancy on the price of wine.  There were 3 bottles in question and the pricing issue was a grand total of $21.  I was told that there was nothing that cold be done, on a $1,000 check. Shortsighted as we won't be going back again.  Additionally looking for the specific cut of meat has become a game.  You have to ask several times and wait a while to get what you want.  And the automatic 18% tip doesn't bring the service that you expect.",2," December 9, 2014"
1889,"Quality of the meats were amzing every time they came to table, buffet was amazing, fresh vegetables and salads at all time.  Top notch!!!!",5," December 3, 2014"
1890,"The food will  just keep coming and that is the meat and some sides. Plenty more to go and get at the massive ""salad bar"" which has some hot food too. Bring an appetite and have some wine  which I also enjoyed.",5," December 3, 2014"
1891,The food quality and the service is amazing. One of the best restaurants that we keep on going back to. Highly recommended.,5," November 27, 2014"
1892,My wife is from Brazil and this provides her a little piece of home.  We both just love the fine meats.  Highly recommended.,5," November 27, 2014"
1893,"I was recently in town with my fianc√© and this place was recommended.  I could not have been more satisfied.  Great food, great service, at a great price.  Did I love everything? No... But I loved most of it and it kept coming and coming and coming! My only negative comment was that I left there hating myself for eating entirely too much =)",5," November 23, 2014"
1894,"I have been to this restaurant a number of times in the past, and I must say that this visit was disappointing.  The good:  The salad bar is very large with a good selection of items and is very fresh.  The bad: The meat (which is the main event) was not what one would expect for over $50pp.  The servers kept coming around with top sirloin, bottom sirloin, and chicken legs.  We had to ask for the filet and lamb.  The sirloin was tough and under seasoned.  I'm not a fan of the chicken legs and sausage.  The restaurant was extremely busy and very loud.  The check was nearly $300 for 4 people.  For that price, I'd rather dine at a real steakhouse.  The service is good, and it's definitely family friendly.",3," November 22, 2014"
1895,Just writing this.  It really is time to go back. Next time I'm staving myself all say first as it was impossible to taste everything I wanted to try. <br/><br/>I think the staff realized we were mostly British as the lamb circulated very regularly around our table.  Salad Buffett absolutely fabulous and so much fresh food to choose from. Putting this in my map for a special lunch treat next time I'm in town. <br/><br/>Great value providing you don't go crazy on the wine and cocktails.,4," November 15, 2014"
1896,"Fogo de Ch√£o (Floor Fire in Portuguese, a reference to barbecue pits) is part of an international chain of ""churrascarias "" that do a very efficient job at ttaking care of even the most gargantuan of hungers. <br/><br/>While the meat cuts that get passed around are of uneven quality and a somewhat restricted variety, if you pick cleverly and supplement with the very fresh salad bar, you can eat very well and have a swell time.  <br/><br/>Nice clean set up, very friendly and dedicated service.  Good caipirinhas!",4," November 13, 2014"
1897,"I enjoy the food at Fogo, but unless you haven't eaten in days the value is largely lost. Two of us for dinner, plus one glass of wine, came out to $150. For that same price a dinner party of 8 could have NY Strip.",3," November 11, 2014"
1898,Excellent lunch.  Service was super fantastic.  Food delicious as usual.  I was stuffed.,5," November 11, 2014"
1899,I do not recommend at all....I have been to many Brazilian steakhouses and this was  so far below the rest that I will never go back. Food slow. Service slow. Buffet was depleted and not refilled. Buffet had less that other such steakhouses. I complained to no avail. Overall I was surprised that in such a prime location..they were unresponsiveness. I guess they get so many tourists/meeting attendees that they figure they do not need to do better.,1," November 8, 2014"
1900,We had a large group and choose Fogo for the dining experience.  Food was wonderful and we had so much fun!!!!  Great place to enjoy outstanding food and have some fun!!!,5," November 8, 2014"
1901,Food was very good but we overdosed on meat.  A once a year place but worth it.,4," November 8, 2014"
1902,"We had fantastic service-wish I could recall the server's name....cuts of meat were generally good, the filet mignon was by far the best. The smoked salmon at the salad bar was delicious too but if you don't love beef, I'd choose another restaurant!",4," November 7, 2014"
1903,My husband and I find ourselves here every few weeks.  The atmosphere is really pleasant as are the servers.  We find the food is of consistently high quality and is a better value than the other steakhouses in the city.,4," October 27, 2014"
1904,I have been to several Brazilian Steakhouses and this one is one of the best.  Great food and Great Service.  The cost is high at over 50 dollars per person but well worth it for the occasional treat.,5," October 26, 2014"
1905,Thank you for your excellent Management and Staff.  Always excellent service and exceptional quality of food.  It is so nice that the Management and Staff remember you.  Thank you for all that you do!,5," October 22, 2014"
1906,"Fogo de Chao is always a great experience! Everything is so good, the buffet is very different from the Churrascaria's in Brazil, very Americanize but other than that everything is great.",4," October 18, 2014"
1907,"I am a big fan of Brazilian BBQ. I have been to many restaurants like this in many different cities. This was certainly - by far, the best of all. Only negative was the high cost.",4," October 18, 2014"
1908,The service was excellent and the food was good. It's a very unique experience. I recommend not filling up too much with the salad bar.,4," October 13, 2014"
1909,"The beef is superb; the salad bar is plentiful, with an excellent, fresh selection. After a few visits, you will learn how to pace yourself and save room for the star -- the fabulous meat preparations. Excellent service verges on being almost too attentive. Only caveat: Too many small children crying, crawling around the floor, or otherwise misbehaving, often can ruin a first-class dining experience. Nonetheless, I have become a frequent diner here.",4," October 12, 2014"
1910,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday!! He enjoyed and had a great time!!We both love and had a great time. The place was beautiful, and wait staff was great!!",5," October 11, 2014"
1911,"Every time I go to this restaurant I wish other restaurant owners would go there to see how it's done. Consistently great food, consistently great service, great place for family, friends, kids, or a romantic dinner. What could be better? An outstanding Brazilian restaurant for dinner and a choice of great deserts at a reasonable price.",1," October 9, 2014"
1912,"This Brazilian Steakhouse is a MUST for all meat lovers. From the different cuts of steak that is offered to chicken and lamb you can't go wrong. The Salad Bar is amazing. They have everything from thinly sliced smoked salmon to asparagus to mozzarella balls to hearts of Palm and artichokes, caesar salad and much more. The drinks here are fantastic. Mojitos and caipirinhas are done very well here. The service is amazing. I can't help but say great things about this place.",5," October 4, 2014"
1913,"I've here a few times and its always a great place to eat and socialize with friends. Fogo de chao is great the buffet, the steak &amp; the caipirinhas are wonderful. The service was ok, they were extremely busy that night and I totally understand! But overall was great!",5," October 4, 2014"
1914,Outstanding experience.....even if you've been here before!,5," October 4, 2014"
1915,"Have been to the FdC in Washington many times, which has always been great.  The Boston location leaves a little behind in almost every dimension.  Dining room area near the salad bar has a bit of a Friday's feel.  Service was a little less attentive.  Meat selection going by seemed to always be the same thing.  The restaurant wasn't especially crowded, so I can attribute it to being too busy...",3," September 30, 2014"
1916,We were placed in a side room and even after asking repeatedly for more of the meat servers to come to our table ( and the rest of the tables in the room) we continued to be ignored. Left hungry if you can believe that!!!,1," September 27, 2014"
1917,"My wife an I have been to various Brazilian steak houses and always enjoy coming back to Fogo de Chao. Their meats are really excellent and we like the large salad buffet. Service here in Boston was very good and attentive. The ambiance is not as ""cozy"" as we experienced it e.g. at Fogo de Chao in DC, but it was still quite nice.",5," September 25, 2014"
1918,Very good as always. Service is excelent and polite. One thing i would like is for more meat to go around constantly as opposed to the same ones and having to ask for the rest,4," September 23, 2014"
1919,"We love Fogo de Chao and celebrate my son's birthday here every year!  It is a great place for groups, but also is very nice for dates. The food is amazing and the service is excellent.",5," September 20, 2014"
1920,"My boyfriend and I came here on 9/20 for his birthday and had a great time. I mentioned in the OpenTable order that it was a birthday dinner, and the waiters brought over a birthday flan cake at the end of the meal, which was both delicious and very appreciated. The food was outstanding like always, and we appreciated the insanely quick service that never left us waiting!<br/><br/>Great spot, would absolutely recommend to friends and family.",5," September 20, 2014"
1921,"I have been to another Brazilian steakhouse, Texas de Brazil, several times, and have been thrilled each time I have gone. I had heard that Fogo was on par, and as there wasn't a close TDB where I was visiting, I gave Fogo a shot. Not nearly as nice, from the salad bar to the quality of the meats. Good still tasted good, and I left full and happy, but was certainly not wowed. Back to TDB for my next Brazilian steakhouse trip...",4," September 19, 2014"
1922,"The food was excellent and the service friendly. The noise and energy level are definitely high, so it's probably not a great choice for a romantic evening but it was very fun and I'd definitely go back.",5," September 19, 2014"
1923,"I had lunch for the first time at Fogo, and it was quieter than during the dinner time.  We did not realize how long we were there as we were able to focus on food and conversation.  A great place!",5," September 18, 2014"
1924,"Don't come here unless you are ready to eat good meats and a lot of them. Great veggies, something for everyone.",5," September 18, 2014"
1925,This was my third trip to Fogo de Chao (Once each to Dallas and Phoenix and now Boston) My wife had never been previously. The food did not disappoint. My wife particularly liked the pork. We hope to return for lunch at some point.,5," September 13, 2014"
1926,"All the food was delicious!  The staff were more than accommodating and efficient, and very attentive!  <br/>Even the valet was on his game in serious rain!  Will go again, for sure!",5," September 13, 2014"
1927,"It was both good &amp; bad because i did get the freshly cooked meat, but the ambiance was a bit more chaotic",4," September 12, 2014"
1928,"This is the kind of place you like to go to once a year -- all you can eat of 16 different cuts of meat. It's great for special occasions. The service was attentive, and we got a good, inexpensive bottle of wine.",4," September 11, 2014"
1929,"Enjoyed another great time... meat is always great, wine was delicious, and the desert selections were also great.",5," September 8, 2014"
1930,"Of you haven't been, I don't know what you're waiting for.  This place is top notch and well worth the price, far cheaper than you would pay for a steak at Morton's and the quality is superior!",5," September 8, 2014"
1931,The Food was great but it was my boyfriends birthday and I had said on the reservation that I would like them to do something special for him. We waited throughout the whole meal and nothing happened.,3," September 3, 2014"
1932,"This was my first time here. I loved everything from the check in to the meal. At first I didn't quite understand how it worked with the food but then we just reasked our waiter and he explained. However the service to get a bottle of wine was a little slow. The server didn't come back to ask if we needed anything until we got our salad bar plates, other than that had a great overall experience!! Well done.",4," August 31, 2014"
1933,As always had a fun evening here. We came for restaurant week but could not help myself and ordered off the regular menu because the food is amazing.  We will definitely be coming back!,5," August 29, 2014"
1934,"We had a fantastic time here last Friday night and ate until we could not possibly fit any meat in our stomachs anymore. With that said, if you're not a meat enthusiast like my friends and me, this is not the place for you. Also, our reservation was a little on the late side at 9pm, but towards the end of our meal, we felt pushed out as the staff started to break down tables and some were leaving. That's pretty typical for restaurants but maybe they could have waited a little longer so we didn't feel like we were inconveniencing them.",4," August 29, 2014"
1935,Terrific service.   Great overall.   Lunch is a great idea to avoid high cost.,5," August 29, 2014"
1936,"We went to Fogo de Chao to celebrate my husband's birthday because we went to the one in Denver a few years ago and really enjoyed it.  Everything was very good.  Salad bar was as extraordinary as ever and all of the meats were very hot and delicious.  It was a meat frenzy with gauchos running back and forth with their offerings.  We asked for the check and I had forgotten that I had listed my husband's birthday as the reason for coming on the reservation.  Instead they brought us a delicious flan with caramel topping and a candle.  I don't know how they remembered this detail with all of the chaos!  I've seen other reviews that nit-pick this restaurant (e.g., the chicken breast was dry) but it was very good and worth the trip.",4," August 29, 2014"
1937,Very different from what I thought it would be better for groups than a romantic dinner...,2," August 28, 2014"
1938,Must really love meat.  Not all neat was tender.  Salad bar very good but sides were mediocre,3," August 28, 2014"
1939,"Had a great time, and the food was delicious.<br/>Even though it was the restaurant week selection, there were still plenty of delectable options!",5," August 28, 2014"
1940,"We have been to Fogo in Boston several times, and it never disappoints. The service is excellent and the food is delicious. I just wish I had a larger appetite to eat more of the polenta and fried banana's. You will leave stuffed. We had a reservation and had not wait to be seated.",5," August 28, 2014"
1941,First time dining here and will come again. Staff was friendly an patient. The only downside is parking.,4," August 27, 2014"
1942,"Came here for restaurant week.  We had a group of 6 people and were promptly seated after all of our members arrived.  Salad bar lacked some of the creativity that other churrascarias have.  Won't knock them too much on the meat selection since we had the restaurant week selection.  The picanha, ribs, and sausage were all excellent, while some of the other meats were a bit dry.  The service was very poor.  Servers would only ask one person in the group if they wanted a certain cut.  Waited about 20 minutes for our check to be taken.  The automatic 18% gratuity is calculated on the post-tax total.  One person owed $10, paid $20 cash, asked for change. and only received $8 back.",2," August 27, 2014"
1943,"A wonderful salad bar with many choices that you can make repeat visits.  They brought mashed potatoes, crisp fried  polenta and warm plantains to every table and delicious cheese rolls.  Various meats are cut and served table side to your specifications.    We went with friends for Boston Restaurant Week, none of us had been there before but we all agreed we would definitely return.  It was an excellent evening.",4," August 27, 2014"
1944,Great food and service. Nice atmosphere! The noise level was low enough not to impede conversation.,5," August 27, 2014"
1945,"I have been to Fogo de Chao(s) in Texas, Chicago, Philadelphia and its competitors like Texas de Brazil and I have to say that this Boston location had the least flavorful meat of all of these other restaurants.  The salad bar was excellent like they are in other locations but the meat was under seasoned and in some cases some of the meat served was very tough and I did not finish certain portions.  It was very disappointing since the purpose to go to this restaurant is most specifically for the meats but other than that everything else was very good including the service.",3," August 26, 2014"
1946,"First time here, came to celebrate 30th anniversary and was not disappointed!  There was not one piece of meat that was bad, all tasted great, salad bar was amazing too!",5," August 26, 2014"
1947,"You cannot beat the Brazilian-style meats here. Typical Brazilian bbq houses that weigh your food are good, but Fogo takes it to the next level. And their complimentary cheese breads are fabulous!",5," August 25, 2014"
1948,"even though we are only 30 minutes to the restaurant final seating, the kitchen still sent endless stream of cuts to us.  the food is fine and generous in portions.  great for meat eaters.",4," August 24, 2014"
1949,"Just simply amazing, the service was great! Every attendant was knowledgeable and you can tell they communicate very well among each other to provide great service. The food was delicious and the selection at the salad bar was great. Just an overall pleasant and filling experience.",5," August 24, 2014"
1950,"We arrived on time for our OpenTable reservation.  When checking in with the hostess I gave my reservation info.  I was told that diners were being seated in order of arrival - not by reservation.  That's strange.  What was even stranger was that I saw 2 other parties without reservations who arrived after us were seated before us.  When we asked what was going on we were seated immediately.  I could tell from the look on the face of the hostess that she had forgotten us, yet she did not apologize or acknowledge her error in any way.  Not a good start.<br/><br/>This visit to Fogo was disappointing.  I was unhappy to see children grabbing food off the salad bar with hands and food on the floor at the salad bar.<br/><br/>Don't know if I would return.",2," August 24, 2014"
1951,"I have been here many times, and love this place.  Last nites service was awful with the waiter we had.  I literately had to get up and chase him down every time I needed something.   It got to the point, when I decided to go to the portable bar myself, where a person named Matt was running it, I explained to him I was trying to get a drink from our nonexistent waiter.  He told me no problem I will come right over and whenever you need anything just yell, he was great!!  When I got my bill I was disappointed I had to leave my waiter gratuity, knowing that he probably has to split it with other servers I tipped my normal 20%.  If I could I would have given it to any of the other staff as they were great and more deserved then our waiter.",3," August 24, 2014"
1952,"The food was great.  The cold buffet was amazing with lots and lots of options.  And the meat just kept coming as long as your card was ""green"" up.  Had to turn the card to ""red"" a few times just to catch up on eating my meat.  Really enjoyable experience.",4," August 24, 2014"
1953,"Had a super time... Service was great and the food was tasty, lots of variety, fun for a special occasion. So much food, everyone happy.",5," August 24, 2014"
1954,"We had some guests over from Europe and so we chose to dine in non-traditional/non-American fashion as likely they will never experience Brazilian delicacies across the pond.  The food was delicious, well-prepared and presented.  The servers were attentive at the beginning of our visit and grew to be less so as the dinner service picked up intensity.  I have to give the servers credit as they were very busy.  My only disappointment was one of the servers was not educated on the ingredients in the cheese bread.  My husband asked if there were eggs in the bread, and he replied no.  My son is highly allergic to eggs.  He took a small bite and within minutes his face was covered in hives.  In the restaurant biz, you have to be allergen-aware!",4," August 23, 2014"
1955,"We had another lovely dinner at Fogo de Chao. It's always fun, with a lot of different dishes to try and meats to taste. We'll be back soon!",5," August 22, 2014"
1956,"The servers were very nice. The garlic mashed potatoes and fried polenta was great. I was a bit overwhelmed with meat, but it all tasted very good.",4," August 22, 2014"
1957,Spectacular presentation of Brazilian Grille. Salad Bar adds to the greatness. Better than found in Brazil or Argentina.<br/>A wonderful addition to Boston's dining offerings.,5," August 22, 2014"
1958,"I went there with three other friends, and we were very satisfied.  They allowed us to take our time in consuming the massive amount of food available through the salad bar and never ending rounds of meat.  Great food, great service.",5," August 22, 2014"
1959,"We've been here before and had spectacular service. Service this evening wasn't so great. Only 3 or 4 kinds of meat were going around when there should have been 10 or more. The pork was extremely overcooked. My friend wanted medium well cuts. The servers offered to return to the table but never did; this happened twice. We told a server we were ready for coffee and desert, then waited forever the server to return. We finally had to talk to someone else. At the end, our bill had two drinks added that were not ours and had to be corrected. Overall, the experience on this visit makes me in much less of a hurry to go back again. They were off their game this night.",3," August 22, 2014"
1960,"I've been to countless Brazilian BBQ/rodizio places in the past but Fogo out-ranks all of them by a wide margin. The quality and quantity of the meats are outstanding. The staff is superb. Other than the noise level (which I understand they can't control), this place was an amazing find!",5," August 22, 2014"
1961,I had an amazing experience at Fogo De Chao during restaurant week!  The salad bar was amazing and the cuts of meat was absolutely delicious. Best bang for your buck. Upscale buffet.,5," August 21, 2014"
1962,"We went during Dine Out Boston for $38/person. You got 10 out of the 16 different cuts of meat from the regular menu ($51/person). Overall the meats were great, and there was a large variety at the salad/appetizer bar. Make sure you call ahead and reserve a table during Dine Out Boston.",4," August 21, 2014"
1963,This restaurant has the best service I've ever experienced at a restaurant! The staff here is outstanding!!!,5," August 21, 2014"
1964,"Varied buffet and a wide choice of meat in a very convenient all-you-can eat formula. Reservation recommended. Wines are very expensive, especially by glass",5," August 20, 2014"
1965,"The meats were very tasty, salad bar had plenty to offer, the rolls and desserts were delicious.  I was not impressed with the other side dishes.<br/>The space is great for ambiance and large enough to accommodate large groups.  Good deal for restaurant week (3 course meal) but not a regular place to visit when your on a budget or have large groups if paying the regular price. Desserts are not included in regular pricing. The waitsaff service was great!",5," August 20, 2014"
1966,"I live the variety of its steaks and the salad bar, cocktails very flavorful. For a fine dining steak house the service wasn't the best.",3," August 20, 2014"
1967,"This place is great, it's not romantic or anything but the food is excellent wait staff is fantastic andthe wine list is real good. A little expensive and the bartenders could be a little bit more generous but other than that very good dining experience I would highly suggest it.",5," August 20, 2014"
1968,"I went there for restaurant week, and it was great! The food was amazing, with some of the best steak, chicken and pork I have ever eaten.  The staff is great and extremely friendly.  Highly recommend it.",5," August 20, 2014"
1969,"It was a enjoyable dinner and the service was excellent. There were many choices of salad and well-prepared side dishes. And also a large selection of meat, but some were dry and tasteless. Overall, there were enough choices to suit everyone as well as it was a fun dinning experience. But this dinner experience can only happen on a special occasion due to the high price tag and ever expanding waistline.",4," August 20, 2014"
1970,WOW!!! Steak and meat was great!  This is the Capital Grill of Brazilian steakhouses.,5," August 17, 2014"
1971,"I frequent Fogo de Chao, on roughly a bi-weekly basis, due to it being a good work-function restaurant and close to where I live. On this visit, I was no less pleased than usual with the salad bar and the charcuterie selection. The food was fresh, well-prepared, presented neatly, and delicious. However, it was the worst instance of customer service I had ever received. <br/><br/>- as one of the servers sliced the meat, a gush of blood jetted out from the steak and sloshed all over my colleague's and my clothes. there was a quick apology and no follow up, despite our repeat complaints <br/>- upon asking, twice, if we could order (and pay for) a serving of the complimentary bread to go, we were promptly forgotten after being assured of an answer<br/>- etc",1," August 16, 2014"
1972,"A great restaurant for Brazilian barbecue or simply steakhouse-style food. The meat was delicious, and the salad bar was excellent as well. If you prefer cuts of meats on the rare/blue side, though, you would have to specifically ask for it. Otherwise, the ambiance is very cosy and welcoming. The service was outstanding: the waiters and waitresses at Fogo de Chao were some of the nicest and most professional we have seen in Boston so far, and all were very attentive.",5," August 10, 2014"
1973,Everything about the restaurant is great! The food is delicious and there is soo much meat that you can choose to eat! The Brazilian lemonade is so yummy!!,5," August 8, 2014"
1974,"We ordered just the salad bar, which is excellent.  The service was non-existent. A waiter brought our wine, that was it.  He never checked back with us.  We waited half an hour for the check...all hints given, asked 3 times.  If you think it will be quick because you serve yourself, not so much.  Exactly what is the tip for?   I wish I could write my own check, it would be perfect!",2," August 7, 2014"
1975,"Enjoyed the meal overall. Some cuts of steak were better than others. But potential diners should know it's $50/person (including salad bar) plus drinks (which are also not cheap), plus dessert. Not really worth it, in my opinion.",3," August 7, 2014"
1976,They serve tons of food and all of it was very good!  The buffet was fantastic but don't fill up on that too much because the meat brought to you tableside is excellent.,4," August 6, 2014"
1977,"The service is fantastic and the food is consistently delicious, season after season. There's a new manager and a few new servers, so the transition was noticeable. However after just a few visits they are back to their old, smooth rhythm of top notch customer service. This is a lunch time favorite.",4," August 6, 2014"
1978,"Very good wine, 17 different type of very good meat, nice buffet with parmesan, prosciutto and difference salad... Maybe too expensive (buffet, meat, wine and dessert at least 100 $ per person... too much! just for special occasion)",4," August 5, 2014"
1979,the best food and service!!! will definitely return. but valet parking is 15.00!,5," August 3, 2014"
1980,"We've been to many Fogo around the United States, and it is always the same experience we go through...great food, great ambiance, excellent service. They should open a Fogo in Montreal or Quebec City, I would be there all the time being a meat lover. <br/>Thanks again for a great evening.",5," August 1, 2014"
1981,My son loves meat. He avoids gluten and dairy and they had a matrix that shows which of their extensive array of foods are safe for him. We had a great time. This place gives gluttony a chance. It was expensive but it was a fair price for the experience.  This might become a favorite for birthdays and other celebrations.,5," July 29, 2014"
1982,Great food and service was incredible but not for the budget minded.,4," July 28, 2014"
1983,"Food was not quite as good as the first time I went to the Boston location (or the one in Miami), but the buffet was still excellent.  Service felt rushed, even though it was a Monday night.",4," July 28, 2014"
1984,"food is good, very salty but tasty. they didn't have our reservation listed even though we made through open table, but they sat us right away as we had a large group.",3," July 26, 2014"
1985,Went to lunch to celebrate a friends' bday. So much food and such variety that we were all very pleased.,5," July 24, 2014"
1986,"Interesting and different type of restaurant, so perfect for a special celebration.  Mix of tourists and business people for mid-week dinner.  Salad bar was very complete.  Beef was great.  Pork consistently over-cooked.",4," July 17, 2014"
1987,"Second time here, a friend really insisted to try. I didn't like it the first time, as it was a far cry from other Fogo de Chao restaurants in Brazil or even in the south USA, e.g. Atlanta. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. Meat selection is limited. Service is courteous but a bit overbearing... you can't spend more than 1 minute without some waiter asking you something, in addition to the meat servers. Ambiance is quiet, clean, and good, which is a plus, of course, but not quite what defines a good churrascaria vs. a bad one. Fogo in Boston seems ""for tourists"". And at $50+ for the buffet plus another $20-40 for drinks, ouch. There are better places around greater Boston. Or treat yourself to a trip to Brazil and try the real deal.",2," July 15, 2014"
1988,"Was in Boston on a business trip and decided to try something different for a friends birthday dinner. <br/>What a treat! If you're a carnivore like us, you could NOT have come to a better place. The ambiance, service, and food made it a wonderful night of celebration.",4," July 14, 2014"
1989,"The restaurant was very accommodating, especially since we had a stroller in tow. The salad bar was definitely extensive and had some good options, although the service was a little slow at the table. And took a long time for the different meats to be brought around. Not even sure we were offered the full selection and when we asked for specific meats took a VERY long time for them to be brought around even though we could see them milling about the dining hall. Add to that it was a Monday night and barely a 1/4 full, would dread to spend that much money on a busy night given the slow service.",3," July 7, 2014"
1990,"Last month I brought my son and his pals.  Based on that experience, I brought a friend here to celebrate her birthday.  She adheres to a gluten-free diet, but loves to eat, which is the reason I chose FdC.  She loved that ~95% of the menu was GF.  They brought her a GF menu listing and she enjoyed the cheesy bread, mashed spuds, and even the polenta.<br/>I was happy with my choice of FdC for her birthday.",5," July 7, 2014"
1991,"This is a nice place for a once-in-a-while type thing or to say you've at least tried it once and can then check it off your list.  Our party consisted of 3 adults and 2 kids (ages 5 &amp; 15 months) and we were seated in the corner - maybe to be out of the way, who knows?! (overall the kids were very well behaved tho - thank you ipad) - but we had a window seat which was nice.  Down side was our table got skipped quite often when servers were making their rounds even though we had people at tables on either side of us and our 'green side' was up.  Probably won't be back but we can say we've tried it, been there done that!",4," July 5, 2014"
1992,The food wasn't well seasoned at all. The people weren't friendly. We had to keep asking for a clean plate. In Atlanta they know how to do it.  The garlic beef is my favorite and here it was awful!,3," July 4, 2014"
1993,"Great opportunity to try a lot of different meats.  The food service was great, but the waitstaff was just mediocre.  My only criticism about the salad bar is that there wasn't any fresh fruit, but they did offer a lot of veggies and cheese.  Great place for a fun family dinner!",4," July 3, 2014"
1994,Food and service always a 10 out of 10!  So accomdating to me and my family.,5," July 3, 2014"
1995,"The quality of the beef is poor. No matter how you cook it, if the beef is poor, there is not much you can do about it.",2," July 3, 2014"
1996,... and had salad bar only.  Excellent. We absolutely did nut need unlimited meats also!  The salad bar had many items including smoked salmon and delicious chicken salad.,4," July 3, 2014"
1997,Came in with the family and parent. The kids love the place as well as the adults. Food was good. It was better before. Service was great!,5," July 2, 2014"
1998,The place is just awesome and everyone is just so nice.,5," June 30, 2014"
1999,"Always fun to go to Fogo, and the food was great as usual.  Although the staff were extremely pleasant and doing their best , there were not as many wandering servers as experienced in the DC location I frequent.  It seemed the variety of foods and frequency of visits did not pass our table.",4," June 28, 2014"
2000,"I have been to a few of this chains locations and find them very consistent. The theatre nature of the meat service makes for a fun time with groups.  It's perfect as a co-worker event, Father's Day gift, or celebratory business deal lunch/dinner.  It's a meat lover's paradise and think about that before bringing people.",4," June 26, 2014"
2001,I've visited several Fogo de Chao locations throughout the US as well as multiple other Brazilian steak house.  Fogo is by far my favorite.  Go hungry because you will be sorely disappointed if you miss tasting any of their sumptuous offerings.,5," June 21, 2014"
2002,"The meat was fatty and if you asked for well done you got medium, if you asked for rare you got medium. The salad bar was ok. Far too loud and service was pretty much non existent. Had to ask four times for chicken. I have been at the one in Scottsdale, Indianapolis and Boston in the past four months. They are off my list of places to go. Far too pricey for mediocre quality.",2," June 21, 2014"
2003,"We went to Fogo de Chao for our anniversary dinner because we had been to another Brazilian barbecue a few years ago and really enjoyed the experience.  The food was good, but it was kind of loud.  The noise might not be such a problem if you get a table that isn't right up next to the buffet.  They had a very large selection of wines and we enjoyed the Alamos Malbec from Argentina.  One other complaint is that the gauchos always seemed to be bringing the same cuts of meat.  I would have like to have tried the pork loin but they never brought it, even after I said I was looking for it.  I recommend skipping the pineapple infused rum.  It isn't really that good, you get only about a shot and it costs $11.  Otherwise it was a good experience.",4," June 21, 2014"
2004,Perfect taste and cuts. I love this place. It is authentic brazilian food,4," June 20, 2014"
2005,This was fine for a one time visit.  I can't imagine going back again and again.  Food was okay - some of the pork was dry - not all the steak was wonderful.  The rib eye and tenderloin were the best of the offerings. Superb salad bar - but don't fill up there.,3," June 19, 2014"
2006,We really enjoyed this-- I am not so much a meat eater so I only had the salad bar but my husband and son really enjoyed the different types of meats and the whole experience.,4," June 15, 2014"
2007,"At least once a month we drive an hour to dine at Fogo de Chao; and several more times a month my husband takes people to lunch there. The staff are terrific and work together as team. They are attentive, but don't hover. The food is delicious. Each time we visit we try something new at the salad bar, which does change seasonally. The staff quickly learn how you like your meat cooked, and return to your table throughout the evening offering you cuts done to your liking. This past Father's Day we also enjoyed desert. I like to try things I don't normally get elsewhere and it's perfect every time.",5," June 15, 2014"
2008,"Despite going on a Saturday night, service was excellent and food did not disappoint. Wine, salad bar and meats all were flavorful and tasty...would definitely return",4," June 14, 2014"
2009,"Fogo de Chao offers the highest quality buffet around.  Every offering is fresh and the quality of product is excellent.  Service is extremely attentive.  The meats are excellent (though sometimes a bit salty), but the ability to offer you any degree of meat rarity for all the variety of meats offered  is wonderful.",5," June 14, 2014"
2010,"Great way to set the table for a night out on the town. Great food, good service, nice selection of alcohol, and a real feeling of intimacy and energy permeates the environment.",4," June 14, 2014"
2011,"I've been to many Fogo de Chao restaurants elsewhere and I am the one in Boston is by far the worst. There is no consistency in the cuts and variety of meats they present. Asked for 2 particular cuts of meat- server said that they did not have them that night. Certain cuts we were never offered and literally had to physically stop the waiters. Waitress was no where to be found - basically saw her at the beginning and at the end. The salad bar was empty most of the time - granted it was a busy Saturday evening, but you would think it would deb better stocked. We showed up on time for our reservations and were seated 25 minutes later with no explanation. Too bad, especially since I thought that their headquarters were now based in Boston.",2," June 7, 2014"
2012,"It is fun tasting the wide variety of meats that are served and the very large salad bar. But, the meats are not in the same class as most of the steak houses in town",3," June 7, 2014"
2013,Food was very delicious and truly made me happy to know it provides true Brazilian styled-taste and perfect service. I did feel a little overwhelmed that the meat sometimes came simultaneously but overall good experience.  ,4," June 6, 2014"
2014,The food is awesome and everyone  is just so nice. We have been there many time and everything has always been awesome ,5," June 2, 2014"
2015,I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and it was great! We've been to the one in Philadelphia and loved it and the experience here was very similar. All of the meat was perfection and our server was attentive without hovering. We will definitely go back! ,4," June 1, 2014"
2016,"The selection of meats were fantastic. The gauchos were very attentive, unlike many other Brazilian steakhouses. The wine list was interesting and the salad bar was vast. Couldn't have asked for a better dinner.",5," May 31, 2014"
2017,"Have been to all of the Fogo locations nationwide, each one is extremely consistent. The decor, the quality of the meat, the spices, just outstanding. I take many people here for their first time to see their reaction, and it always stuns them!",5," May 27, 2014"
2018,"It all starts with an amazing salad buffet that includes among other things smoked salmon and prosciuto crudo. You can also help yourself to a very well seasoned ""rice and beans"" Brazilian style. And then there is the meat, a lot of meat, as much as you can eat, several different types.",4," May 25, 2014"
2019,"Food was good - delicious, well cooked meats always available whenever you want. Good variety of cuts (prime rib, filet, lamb, chicken, beef, etc). Deal is that you get all you can eat meat, salad bar, and a couple of side dishes for $55/person. Drinks are separate (the cachacas were very good). <br/><br/>Good experience on the whole - waitstaff friendly, service good. Question is just on value - for a buffet/all you can eat experience, not sure $55 is the right price point. Felt like a $30-$35/person value. ",3," May 25, 2014"
2020,"Hands down, this is one of the best Brazilian places in Boston (at least of those I know). The food and service are absolutely great. Of course, this comes with a price...",4," May 25, 2014"
2021,Food was great and the service was prompt... can't ask for anything else!,5," May 20, 2014"
2022,"The staff was very attentive to our <br/>Table . Food was excellent and they<br/>Did something special for my 2 <br/>Sons, 1 graduation, 1 birthday . Also,<br/>Thank you to the valet guys for going <br/>Back and getting my daughters phone ! ",5," May 18, 2014"
2023,Aaaali bud,5," May 17, 2014"
2024,Disappointed - we reserved over a month ago for a graduation celebration for 7 people.   We were on time for our reservation however they made us wait almost 15 min for our table.  When we sat down we were right next to the kitchen &amp; the lights &amp; traffic to/from the kitchen were annoying.  There were plenty of open tables but we were told they were reserved.    So was ours?,4," May 17, 2014"
2025,The food was great.  Service was great too!  Highly recommend.,5," May 16, 2014"
2026,"If you love really great beef, pork, lamb and even chicken, this is the spot for you. Everything is done perfectly and you get to taste everything and, to boot, cooked as you like it! Wait staff is friendly and brings your favorites to your table. Mention you want something and they send it to your table. I mentioned that I wanted to taste the beef ribs and there they were not 5 minutes later. The salad bar is outstanding and the warm cheese bread (lighter than air) should not be ignored! Loved the inventive cocktails, too. The waiter overheard it was my birthday and he had the flan we ordered sporting a candle &amp; a ""happy birthday"".",5," May 16, 2014"
2027,"When I joined my friend at the bar, bartender did not even noticed it(we were the only people at the bar!)Few more people arived it was no reaction from him,we have to flag him to get a drink. Host stand never smiles, when our table was ready they told 2 people and forget about other 7. Then host told us that party was seated in a dining room, we asked where, non of 2 hostess showed us or tell where, just somewhere in dining room. If I spend almost 100$ per person, I expect some service.Place open 5 tp 10pm, only for 5 hours.All servers and meet guys desepered after 9pm.We wanted to get more drinks and desert but couldn't fond anyone to orded.We decided to go somewhere else. Music was off at 9.30pm, to let us know to get out soon?",1," May 13, 2014"
2028,Wonderful and a great variety of food. Staff is friendly and patient,5," May 13, 2014"
2029,"Good experience, great service, but the food is lackluster. Although the meat is plentiful, it isn't seasoned and after a while everything tastes the same. Salad bar is well stocked, but nothing spectacular. Overall this isn't worth the price. You can get the same thing (and probably tastier food) at a much more reasonable price at one of the many other Brazilian steakhouses in Cambridge or Framingham for example.",2," May 10, 2014"
2030,A different type of dining.  Great salad bar and delicious meats served just the way you like it cooked!<br/>Not very noisy as I think the restaurant is carpeted.  Good for larger parties too.  <br/>Service was excellent and waitstaff very friendly and solicitous.  ,4," May 4, 2014"
2031,"I love the place.<br/>Well located and around the corner from me, food is great. But service needs a bit of an upgrade, sometimes there is a long wait for a server to come and check the tables.<br/>",5," May 4, 2014"
2032,I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. He had never heard of it. He was blown away by the food and service. I love it here.,5," May 3, 2014"
2033,"This place isn't for the faint of heart or those on a diet. Talk about meat coma. While the ambiance is a little hokey (the waitstaff wear gauchos), most cuts of meat are really delicious. Tip: Be honest with yourself and don't overload it on the salad bar. You're there for the beef.",4," May 3, 2014"
2034,"I came here for my graduation celebration with a large group and it was a great decision. Although it takes a strategy going in (minimal salad bar) I was very happy with the way the meal went. The staff was very friendly and attentive and they even went out of their way to make a cake that spelled out ""Congratulations"" - something that I apparently don't usually do. I would have to say that the daily special was the best, it was an amazing rare cooked steak that had the charred fatty ends still on. It was amazing. All in all, the meal was great and the food was delicious. I would certainly come back!",5," May 2, 2014"
2035,"We have visited Fogo de Chao Boston 3-4 times, with a group and as a couple.  We arrived earlier (5:30) than normal and found this to be a great time to dine at Fogo- Boston, the waiters weren't as rushed from table to table, the food was hot and cooked perfectly for Medium-medium rare meats.  Overall the staff seemed more attendant and was able to partake in a bit on light conversation while visiting the tables, this gets harder as the night goes on and Fogo becomes quite busy. The cheese filled bread is the best part!!!",4," April 30, 2014"
2036,"This was my families first visit to Fogo De Chao and we were all very impressed and satisfied.  Variety and delicious are the best ways to describe the dining experience at Fogo.  Beginning with the salad bar there is no shortage of delicious choices from meats, fish, cheeses and salads of every variety.  You have to be measured in your salad bar visits as the real feeding frenzy begins when you flip your table card from red to green and the endless parade of meats come to your table.  Our favorites were the bacon wrapped filet, parmesan crusted pork tenderloin, beef tenderloin and sausages.  So much to choose from with the only limit being your appetites capacity. ",4," April 26, 2014"
2037,"We went out for my mothers birthday.  Talk about services, they do it right!!! They give each person a card for food that has the typical red for stop and green for load my plate and that they did!!   I have been to other places where I just wondering when the next piece of meet is coming, I had to flip my card to stop the overwhelming amount of meats on my plate to catch up, never have done this at any other place!!  we all had our favorites out of the pick, and when we asked for more of what we liked, they were prompt in catering to our needs.  Hats off to the chef and servers!! We will be back for more!!!",5," April 26, 2014"
2038,The best part about this restaurant is the super attentive and friendly staff. The food is solid but nothing spectacular - definitely does not measure up to hard core Brazillian places. The caiparinhas are very nice - definitely go with the classic. ,4," April 25, 2014"
2039,My favorite restaurant for the food and the service. ,5," April 25, 2014"
2040,It was a unique experience! I recommend people who LOVE meat. ,5," April 24, 2014"

2043,"I was there on Easter Sunday; so a special Sunday; too many people; service had problem to attend all the crowd coming  pretty much at the same time; that was not my mainly concern I understand the special event; what I did not like was the temper of the meat; no tasty at all; I have been to your place several times and I always liked your meet, very tasty, juicy, very good indeed !  so this  time for me was not so good; Good Luck <br/>",2," April 20, 2014"
2044,Not quite like Plataforma in NYC but Fogo is a close second. Prices are a bit steep but the food makes it all worth it. Salad bar has everything u need to fill up quickly so slow down on the salad before the meat starts coming your way. Plenty of cocktails to chose from and they're quite strong too. Overall great dinner experience ,4," April 16, 2014"
2045,Took my college age niece. We loved the selections at the salad bar. It was fun to have meat skewers brought to table but size of cuts very thin and small. Nice location at Copley. Very busy when we went but never waited long for service .,4," April 14, 2014"
2046,"This is definitely a unique restaurant. Pace yourself or you will fill up too fast. So much on the salad bar, and then comes all the different meats with sides dishes. Expensive but worth it for a special occasion.",5," April 12, 2014"
2047,"Although the restaurant is advertised as a meat place, they have a wonderful help yourself buffet salad bar with excellent smoked salmon, jamon serrano, and manchego. The eat as much as you want meat keeps coming to your table on skewers as long as your disc shows green. To stop turn it over to red. The meats include excellent cuts of beef, lamb chops, chicken and pork sausages and many others. Lunch time is a cheaper but avoid breakfast if you go.",5," April 10, 2014"
2048,"Good Food ad Great sides, Maybe the sides are the show.",3," April 8, 2014"
2049,We went to Fogo for my husbands 30th birthday and had a great time. Friendly staff and amazing food. The meal was delicious. The only downside is that the meal goes by at a fast pace because the staff keeps coming by with meat options and we ate too quickly. This was out fault!,4," April 5, 2014"
2050,I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and LOVE it!! The food and service is always excellent.,5," April 5, 2014"
2051,Some many meat choices it's a wonderful choice for the meat eater on a binge. Great wine list and service. Also a nice setting for a large group meal or celebration. A treat for out of town guests after a tour of scenic Boston.,5," April 5, 2014"
2052,Good was good. Some of it was great. Service was just shy of excellent. Spot to enjoy a leisurely dinner with friends.,4," April 3, 2014"
2053,"We enjoyed our dinner, the only complaint I had was we were never offered the lamb chops, I had to request it a few times.",4," March 29, 2014"
2054,"The food was amazing. The salad bar was packed with fresh and delicious cheese, prosciutto, salami and bread, among other salads and veggies. Great wine list. Tons of different meats to choose from. Service was outstanding. Excellent for a special occasion dinner.",5," March 28, 2014"
2055,"We have been to Fogo many times in many locations, and the food is always outstanding, and this experience was no exception. It is our favorite restaurant, bar none.",5," March 28, 2014"
2056,Food was delicious!!! Salad bar is unlike any other salad bar out there. Incredible!!! Meats were perfect. Love the bacon wrapped chicken. Margarita was made to perfection !!!,5," March 28, 2014"
2057,"As always, the staff are attentive and personable. We've dined here several times and are always impressed with the staff. They prepare a delicious salad bar that has something for everyone. At the table, the staff are always at the ready to top off a glass and bring a favorite. They work as a team and service is superior.",5," March 27, 2014"
2058,"The food was fantastic, from the meat to the side dishes! It is on the expensive side but it is worth it. They have a great variety of meat cuts cooked to perfection.",5," March 23, 2014"
2059,We met my nephew for dinner here mostly for location. The salad bar is complete and filled with unusual options. We had to be very vigilant with the green card. They are very efficient at adding to your plate. The meats are wonderful and it is very easy to get a little over the top.,4," March 19, 2014"
2060,Expensive for the quality of food. Check your bill...we realized later that we were over charged...there was six of us and we were billed for eight meals.,2," March 14, 2014"
2061,"I joined my husband for lunch at Fogo de Chao and both the food and service were terrific. The salad bar is wonderful. It's stocked with a large variety of food that's top notch. But, don't fill up on the salad bar! Table service is delicious too. The staff is well trained and very attentive. Reservations are helpful for lunch, but if you go early without one, you may not have to wait. Thank you Fogo de Chao for a wonderful lunch.",5," March 14, 2014"
2062,Place was amazing. Cannot wait to go back for the Filet. Hands down The best peice of Meat I have Ever had,5," March 13, 2014"
2063,The salad bar is amazing - so many option; next time I may just get the salad bar. The parmesan crusted pork loin was the best!!,5," March 12, 2014"
2064,Just so many cuts of meat. You need to come hungry. Just a meal you don't have often.,5," March 12, 2014"
2065,"The food was excellent. The salad bar had a very nice selection of salads, cheeses, cold meats, as well as some fish selections. My wife wasn't feeling up for the meat portion of the meal, so just stuck with the salad bar and was pleased with the choices available. I went for the full monty, and was not disappointed. The non-stop offerings were all politely presented by very attentive chefs. Servings of any individual selection were not too large, allowing you to try as many different offerings as possible. That said, they'll keep it coming until you say 'enough'. The meat is prepared over open flame and seasoned only with salt. Some reviews have indicated their steaks were too salty. I didn't find that to be the case.",5," March 9, 2014"
2066,I never thought I would say this but I think this just too much meat and food in general. Tasted amazing and the service was the best I've had in a while.,3," March 9, 2014"
2067,"Save your money and go find either a real churrascuria or a real high-end restaurant. This is neither. These people have taken all the joy, flavor and funk out and inflated the real-estate, decor and cost. We spent (literally) $666 for a noisy, corporate, soul-less, and flavor-wise indifferent dinner for 6. The best part by far - was that we did manage to find a good bottle on wine on the list. Did it without any guidance from the wait-staff. Not sure if they had a sommelier on the staff, but none visited with us or was even mentioned, and the waitstaff we encountered (nice enough kids) were clueless about wine. On the bright side, the bill did automatically include a $95 tip so I guess actual knowledge and service weren't required.",2," March 8, 2014"
2068,"Enjoyed the full experience; food was fatty but flavorful and the overall atmosphere was very fun. Would probably not go back for a few months, but that's likely only to have my arteries recover.",4," March 8, 2014"
2069,"I've been to Fogo de Chao in Sao Paulo and in Rio and this one is a far cry from its Brazilian counterparts, more like an ""Epcot Theme Park"" version. The selection of meats and their preparation is acceptable, but nothing to write home about. Servers are aloof, they may come five times in one minute, disappear for half an hour afterwards, bring the wrong drink, apologize, bring another wrong drink. And so on. If you like Churrascaria, there are better places (and much cheaper) in greater Boston. I had great hopes, but I won't go back.",2," March 7, 2014"
2070,"If you love meat , it's the place to go. The meats are tasty and well seasoned cooked the way you like. Most impressed by the service though. Friendly and energetic staff. They never miss a beat. Their attention is on you!<br/>Allef our waiter was a gem... He made it even more special. We had a great time.",5," March 7, 2014"
2071,"Fogo de Chao's is definitely a dining experience; followed by good food. As soon as you walk in you can get a mild sense of the atmosphere. Once you start walking to get seated, you are presented with the full display of what this restaurant is. Many people moving to provide excellent service. I was a little overwhelmed at first but got used to it once I flipped my card over. The meat was great! I wish there was a dipping sauce or something but flavor was really good. The sides were just enough and once you ran out they continue to re-fill. The drinks are superb and strong. Overall I liked it. Definitely something to check off my list of restaurants to try!",3," March 7, 2014"
2072,"Outstanding environment, delicious everything and so many choices!!",5," March 1, 2014"
2073,"Had the pleasure of dining here recently, and loved it. I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses, so I knew what to expect food-wise and it did not disappoint. The service in all aspects was very good, although when flipping the card to green, it was a little overwhelming, we had guys with skewers of meat waiting to dispense their goods. The ambience of the room is great - my party was there for over 3 hours and we never felt rushed. I would recommend and I will return.",4," March 1, 2014"
2074,"We went mainly for the unique experience of waiters personally shaving meats for you. Our expectations for food weren't 5-star but for the menu price we hoped it'd be pretty good tasting.<br/><br/>Pros: All-you-can-eat salad bar was a great start. The servers were personable and enthusiastic.<br/><br/>Cons: A few of the meats were tasty but most were far too salty (to the point that they were inedible). Also - service was chaotic and it took over 45 minutes to receive and pay our bill.<br/><br/>Summary: All-in-all, it was an OK night. We left full and had fun. It wasn't a night of complete regret but we had higher expectations given what we paid. Overall I'd call it a ""so-so"" experience and something we can now say we've done once but won't be rushing to do again.",3," March 1, 2014"
2075,"I ate here for a business dinner. The meat was outstanding coupled with an excellent ""salad"" bar or side bar. The service was outstanding. Our plates were never empty, always clean and our water always filled. Great service and great food.",4," February 27, 2014"
2076,Fogo offers excellent meats and a great selection. The service was excellent and the experience was overall great!,5," February 27, 2014"
2077,"Then this is a good choice. In addition to its salad bar (which is good, but has a surprising lack of greens), the meat just keeps coming. Be sure to be selective and insist on the type and cut you prefer. They will come back with what you want. One word of caution: your bill will rise quickly due to the price of drinks, and they are very adept at keeping those coming as well.",3," February 23, 2014"
2078,We were celebrating my husband birthday with a friends.<br/>Good company &amp; great food was a plus!,5," February 22, 2014"
2079,If you want to have a good and traditional brazilian steak go to this restaurant. The meat doen`t stop to come. I have to turn my card to red because I couldn`t have more meat in my plate.... hahahahaha. Very beautiful place. I would come back more often if it would be less expensive. But it worthed a lot for a very special occasion.,5," February 22, 2014"
2080,"Wonderful meal at Fogo de Chao.We were a party of 6, with a reservation at 7:30p.The waiting area was packed and so was the bar. I was hearing 2+ hour waits without a reservation. We were seated a few minutes after our arrival. The waitress immediately came to our table to settle us in and get our drink orders. The first course is the salad bar and it was delicious. Nice assortment of cheeses, salmon, cold salads, lettuce and other salad fixings. Once done with our salads, we turned over our discs to green and the meats started coming. Wow. If you like beef, lamb, pork ribs - this place is for you! You can just get the salad bar if you have someone who doesn't eat meat (we did) but just make sure you tell your server ahead of time.",5," February 22, 2014"
2081,The service was great and the food was awesome!!! My boyfriend loved it so much :),5," February 18, 2014"
2082,"We wouldn't go back but it's a great place for students who can go there, not pay an arm and a leg, and eat as much meat as their heart desires :)<br/>Service was very efficient and friendly.",2," February 17, 2014"
2083,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. I am very picky when it comes to good churrascurias, as I have lived in Framingham, MA. Needless to say, my bar is set pretty high. We had made reservations for 6pm; however, we had ended up arriving early and they were great about allowing us to change the reservation. They seated us promptly and led us to a cute little table for 2. They started us off with pao de quiejo (cheese bread) which were absolutely amazing. I am quite picky when it comes to those too! In typical rodizio style, the gauchos come around with skewers of 14 types of meat. They were amazingly delicious. The service was impeccable. They work as a team and you are never without anyone asking if you are all set.",5," February 17, 2014"
2084,Always simply wonderful. Picanha all the way :-),5," February 16, 2014"
2085,"Great Brazilian concept, ""wandering minstrels of food"". Brazilians ""live to eat"". Great meat just kept coming.",5," February 15, 2014"
2086,"Very young crowd, not really for us older folks. Great Food, Great service.",4," February 14, 2014"
2087,This place has all kinds of meats. A great place for big groups to enjoy food. Salad bar was huge,5," February 14, 2014"
2088,"The food is excellent. The salad bar is excellent. You could eat like a king from the salad bar alone. The salad bar includes salmon, bacon, and other meats as well. Be careful not to fill up to much as you won't have room for the main courses. All you can eat steak. The steaks are really good and you can have a slice anyway you want it. Fantastic for a group of people but I prefer a smaller darker style restaurant for a date spot. This is wide open like a food court.",5," February 14, 2014"
2089,I love it... great food and amazing service.,5," February 14, 2014"
2090,We went to Fogo for Valentine's Day 2014. A bit disappointing since the food is fantastic but the original server was terrible. We usually have 3-4 caipirinhia's at our other favorite Brazilian restaurant (Oasis in Medford) but after waiting 30 minutes for our first drink we gave up.,4," February 14, 2014"
2091,Went here for Valentines day and it was one of the best meals I have ever had. The service was outstanding and the food was mouth watering. I was afraid it would be too expensive at first but the quality and experience was completely worth it.,5," February 14, 2014"
2092,"Great ambience and great location inside the Westin, absolutely perfect for special occasions such as Valentine's or anniversary. The staffs are all very friendly and collaborate well with each other. The cheesy breads (pao de queijo) are fantastic! The salad bar and meat selections were all wonderful. My only complaint is that in terms of meat seasoning, I would rate it as 4/5 stars, the seasoning did not penetrate as deep into the meat as some other Brazilian steak houses. Otherwise everything is perfect!",5," February 14, 2014"
2093,Everyone in this restaurant is so nice. They bring the meat to the table and it's so delicious. They giving me just the way you want it. Their salad bar is amazing. We been to this restaurant about 10 times and just love it. Everyone should go!!!!!!?,5," February 14, 2014"
2094,Food was delicious &amp; service very good. Plan to return.,4," February 12, 2014"
2095,"Fun experiencing Rod√≠zio service of succulent meats and friendly service. Salad and side bar had wonderful mix, and the New York Cheesecake - well I enjoyed every bite! Excellent place to bring a client or family for dinner.",5," February 11, 2014"
2096,Every single thing i tried was delicious! Can't complain about the food at all. The service was outstanding - always had someone come to my table to ask if we understood how the restaurant worked. Definitely going again!!,5," February 9, 2014"
2097,"Southern Brazil, similar to my wife's northern Uruguay, a land of gauchos, baggy pants, big campfires and an ever ready knife to carve off a tasty piece of meat. The meat, excellent. The variety, excellent. Great for a big group, since dinner here is an EVENT and a lot of fun",4," February 9, 2014"
2098,I celebrated with (2) friends over a great meal and wine. The entire staff made the experience perfect. We all plan on going again.,5," February 6, 2014"
2099,"Great salad bar, food and drinks but just a litte too pricy for a regular night out.",4," February 6, 2014"
2100,"Service slow - at times non-existent. Server never took drink orders. When we ordered drinks they arrived 1/2 way through dinner. Meat selections were often well done. We asked servers to return with rarer selections but they never did. Our green cards were ignored many times. This was our third time to this restaurant, and it's typically our favorite. After our experience last Saturday night, I would be hard pressed to pay the price tag again. Possibly the worst service we have ever received in a restaurant anywhere.",1," February 2, 2014"
2101,The salad bar was really good and each cut of meat was better than the one before.,5," February 1, 2014"
2102,"Large amazing salad bar, and the meat was wonderful. Service excellent....",4," January 31, 2014"
2103,Food is always great in these places and the gauchos come by pretty regularly. Oddly at this particular night after we cleared the table we had to send two separate people to ask for the check.,4," January 28, 2014"
2104,The title may sound funny for a Brazilian restaurant but I love it and I only eat a small amount of meat compared to everything else. The salads and side dishes are numerous and delicious. We like to go when we want to spend a longer time talking and enjoying our time together. Great for people who love lots of food too. But my reason to go there is to make eating out an event for my family. Also really great place for gluten free there are only two items that a person with a gluten allergy can't eat. The cheese bread is a favorite! (Made with tapioca flour),4," January 24, 2014"
2105,Just what 5 hungry men were looking for.<br/>Service and food were way above average.,4," January 24, 2014"
2106,"More than a restaurant, Fogo De Chao is a unique eating experience that included top-line meat, huge assortment of salad bar options, terrific service and high style ambience.<br/><br/>Everything we tried was delicious. Servers were attentive. Meat was freshly cooked, tender and nicely seasoned.<br/><br/>Would definitely return. Highly recommend.",5," January 24, 2014"
2107,You could just eat the salad bar but you would miss out on lamb chops,5," January 23, 2014"
2108,The food here was amazing! Everything was so fresh and delicious. We were there at lunch so there wasn't a crowd and we felt like royalty being waited on by so many people. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a meat eater! Some of the best steak I have had.,5," January 21, 2014"
2109,"Very nice Brazilian steakhouse restaurant. Done upscale, with a huge bar of side dishes, great quality meat, and excellent service. Nice drink menu doesn't hurt either. Really sizable restaurant, so probably very good for groups!",5," January 17, 2014"
2110,"We enjoyed our dinner again at Fogo. Interesting salad bar, delicious and plentiful meat selections and yummy drinks. Always a fun night!",5," January 10, 2014"
2111,"Everything about this restaurant is perfection. The salad bar is beautiful - fresh, constantly replenished, interesting offerings along with staples. The waitstaff anticipates your needs replenishing side dishes, etc. and fulfilling special requests. My napkin dropped on the floor and a waiter handed me a fresh napkin before I could reach down to get mine! As long as your card is green - the waiters keep coming with 13 different types of beef, lamb, pork, and chicken. The meats are cooked perfectly - tender, flavorful, and so aromatic...and you will eat until you literally can't eat any more! Although it is ""pricey"", the quality of the food and service was worth this experience.",5," January 9, 2014"
2112,"My husband and I went to Fogo on a week night for dinner and it was fantastic. Service was excellent, they work in teams and everyone was friendly, polite, there any moment we needed them and helpful with answering our questions. The salad bar was huge and really good but tough to stay away from knowing we just wanted to eat meat. And the meat, it was really good. I love steak and chicken but tried everything. Other than meats I don't personally enjoy, the rest were great and after trying each kind the servers were more than happy to bring back specific cuts we wanted seconds of.",5," January 8, 2014"
2113,Awesome food and service! Can't wait to go back!!,5," January 5, 2014"
2114,"We went here for a birthday party and were pleasantly surprised. We were seated promptly and our service all night was spectacular. Though not all of the meats were notable, the ability to try such a variety was great and the ones that were good we couldn't get enough. For those members of our group who opted for the salad bar only.. WOW what a surprise. The salad bar was more than enough food with dishes ranging from your regular salad ingredients, pasta salads, smoked salmon, rice &amp; beans, coconut haddock just to name a few. Needless to say everyone in our group left highly satisfied and not needing to eat for days!",5," January 4, 2014"
2115,"I was very excited when I found out Fogo was opening in Boston. The service is outstanding the gaucho chefs &amp; waitstaff are very attentive. The food however is only a ""good"" rating overall The salad bar is great there is much more than the typical ""greens"", The meat is just ""good"". When the gaucho chefs come to your table the portions that they slice for you a very small. Yes, you can keep your card flipped until you are filled, and tasted all you like, but you're not going to have a satisfactory filling of any particular cut of meat.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a ""once is enough"" place and not one I will go back to again and again. I'd rather go to a good Steakhouse.",3," January 3, 2014"
2116,The food here is amazing and just keeps on coming. You can request specific cuts and although all are great the filet cuts are best. The servers work as a team and seem to be available all the time and all were extremely pleasant. Great spot for large family functions or work parties.,5," January 1, 2014"
2117,"Terrible service and lots of overdone meat. Staff received requests from the entire large table for rarer meats, and they kept coming around with medium well. No attention to detail, and some staff not very pleasant. I was the organizer and chose this place and apologized to all.",2," January 1, 2014"
2118,We love this place and go here all of the time! The waitstaff is unbelievable and the food is amazing!,5," December 31, 2013"
2119,"Love this place, they do Brazilian churrascaria proud, great meats, huge, fresh salad bar, and great service. Went there for NYE as it is convenient to many of Boston's First Night activities. Service was as always attentive and brought the meats we didn't see but wanted. Thx!",5," December 31, 2013"
2120,If you know Brazilian food well you probably will not be impressed. The food is good but not great which is understandable - food is not seasoned the the way it is done in Brazil and it may suit more the American palate. Pricey for what it is delivered.,3," December 30, 2013"
2121,"Fogo de Ch√£o has a great concept. You sit down, your wait staff greets you to give you the rules of the restaurant and off you go to an incredible salad bar. Ready to have your main course --15 choice meats are served and carved at your table. You are given a disk with green on one side and red on the other. You want to eat keep the green side up -- you've had enough -- the red side is up. The Gauchos just keep coming. The side dishes are great as well. It's all you can eat. So if you like to eat this is your place. Decor is upscale. The service attentive without being overbearing. Great location in the middle of Copley square attached to Westin Hotel. You will not be disappointed. Great place for a large group.",5," December 27, 2013"
2122,The second time with my family at Fogo. The food is very good and the service very attentive. You can hardly go 2 minutes before another gaucho is coming by with another cut of meat. The salad bar was good with very fresh items.,4," December 24, 2013"
2123,"There is a great selection of meats to choose from. I would suggest looking through their selection on the menu at the beginning to prioritize what you want to try before you get too full. Don't fill up too much on the salad bar, although it's also delicious. The cheese bread is absolutely delicious! Loved this restaurant. Pricey, but worth it.",4," December 24, 2013"
2124,"Where to begin? It was our first time and we were not disappointed! What a fabulous evening! The martinis were the best we have enjoyed, and the food was truly superb - the perfect way to try many different beef offerings. Wait staff couldn't have been better. This was both a friendly atmosphere and one where we felt truly cared for. Suggestions were excellent. PLEASE don't be concerned that this is a Brazilian steakhouse where you fear you might not like the food, especially if you are a less-than- adventurous diner! Do be aware, this is a bit pricey. The bill for three women was a bit over 300, but we enjoyed two cocktails each and really yummy desserts - those are over and above the 49 dinner charge. You will LOVE this great spot!",5," December 14, 2013"
2125,We always enjoy Fogo.    It's my teen son's favorite!,5," December 14, 2013"
2126,"I came here with a group of 6 people and we had a blast. The food was outstanding! It is definitely a lively atmosphere and probably would not recommend it if you want a quiet, romantic evening. I was a little disappointed in that it was so busy, we did not get to try all of the different meat they have on the menu. We sometimes had to wait a good 10 to 15 minutes for a server to come by with another cut of meat. I ate at Fogo de Chao in Dallas recently and while it's not fair to compare the two (Dallas was not nearly as busy due to the time of day), I actually had a better experience there because I literally got to try everything on the menu. I will definitely come back here and will try to get an earlier reservation.",4," December 13, 2013"
2127,"As always the service and food are wonderful,",5," December 12, 2013"
2128,"This visit left much to be desired. Service was slow and we could not get the cuts we wanted. When a skewer came around, the server always gave an end cut when we wanted an interior portion. We had to make repeated requests for top sirloin and it only came around after considerable time. However, the chicken/sausage skewer was in plentiful abundance and kept coming back to our table though we politely declined each time. We saw the filet only once. The bread dish and grilled bananas were quickly removed from the table and we had to ask several times before getting a second helping. No cream was delivered with the coffee and it took forever to flag someone down.<br/>The salad bar is great and the meat is quite good when delivered.",3," December 7, 2013"
2129,The food and service are top notch. Can't wait to go back again,4," December 6, 2013"
2130,"I have been here on a few occasions and make a mental note not to come back unless on someone else's expense account. The quality is great and service is great, but the fixed price is a bit high for what you get (unless you are a bunch of burly guys who can consume a a least a pound and a half of meat each). Worse than that, however, are the add-ons--really silly prices for decent-not-amazing caipirinhas, wines and other beverages, and desserts. Clearly, this is a place for the expense-account set. It is a quality experience but not necessarily value-for-money.",4," December 6, 2013"
2131,"I am not a big meat eater but I enjoyed the many selections. You get full very quickly! I particularly loved the the lamb chops, my mouth is watering now at the thought of them! The cost is fair considering how much meat you can consume. Not an intimate environment and mostly it's about eating and very little talking!",3," December 4, 2013"
2132,awesome place. the best food and service.,5," December 1, 2013"
2133,"I've eaten at most of the Brazilian barbecue (rodizio) places around Boston and this is by far the best. From the white table cloths and superior service, to the superior salad/vegetable bar to the quality and variety of meats carved at your table, it's an excellent choice. At about $50.00 pp (supper) not including beverages or dessert it's not inexpensive, but it's an upscale experience and one of my favorite places to entertain visitors.",5," December 1, 2013"
2134,We went for the full experience with all the meats on the skewer and ended up having the 35 item salad bar. It was the largest freshest salad antipasto bar we have seen in a very long time. We had some pre cocktails at the bar before our reservation. They were very friendly and service was great. Can't wait to go back when we are more hungry.,4," November 30, 2013"
2135,This is perhaps the 4th time I've eaten at Fogo. Per usual the service is significantly better then most restaurants. Used open table about 45 min prior to the time we needed. Fogo sat us immediately. Food overall was Ok. Not spectacular. Filet Mignon was perfect as was the lamb. I found that some of the cuts were slightly on the cold side. I would not let some of the negatives out weigh the overall experience. Fogo is a good spot and fun.,4," November 29, 2013"
2136,"I took my 22 year old son here, he really enjoyed this place. It's a real guy place, lots of meat.",4," November 25, 2013"
2137,Wait staff was helpful and friendly and there was always someone near to respond to any request. Food was excellent and the salad bar is amazing. Tons of choices and a great wine list.,5," November 23, 2013"
2138,"I've been in some other Fogos and I think its the best one. Excelent food, great service and very good location in Boston!<br/>I definitely go again in my next visit to the city!",5," November 23, 2013"
2139,"Great Brazilain Steak House. Lots of choices on the salad bar. Frequently repelenished. Servers with skewers of food came every few minutes, all hot and delicious. Attention to detail by wait staff excellent. Highly recommend and can't wait to go again.",5," November 22, 2013"
2140,"Never been to a Brazilian Steak House before and we had an amazing experience. What a fantastic service, wonderful salad bar, great food. We would recommend this to a group and romantic dining. We will come again.",5," November 22, 2013"
2141,Staff were very alert and welcoming... super duper friendly. Very knowledgeable of the menu and cuts- it came in handy. Come hungry and get at it. Delicious meats!,4," November 22, 2013"
2142,The wait service was phenomenal. The meats were tender and delicious. It's nice to be able and sit and take your time to try everything. We were there for a special birthday dinner and were there close to two hours!,5," November 16, 2013"
2143,"Probably going to be my go-to place for special occasions. While it was a little expensive, me and my two girlfriends had a very good experience and I can't wait until I can go back again. The service was a little TOO over the top, but I understand they do what they have to do...<br/><br/>also.... cheese balls.",4," November 15, 2013"
2144,The salad bar was the highlight of the lunch there items were very fresh and the assortment had great variety. Overall the meets were good with the best and most tasty the house steak. The leg of lamb was tough and overly seasoned.,3," November 15, 2013"
2145,"Friends from Europe and I had dinner here recently. Our drinks were well made and served promptly. The salad bar was filled with a great variety of vegetables and salad ingredients. Servers passed by very often to offer us a variety of meats. And the side dishes -- garlic mashed potatoes, baked bananas and polenta -- were very tasty. All in all, it was a very enjoyable dining experience. The decor was attractive and the location very convenient.",4," November 14, 2013"
2146,We had a wonderful dinner at our fifth visit to Fogo de Chao. The food is great as is the service. Highly recommend when you are in the mood for steak and salad.,5," November 11, 2013"
2147,"We had a fantastic time. Great food, great service, and a great place. Also, so easy to be gluten free!!!!",5," November 11, 2013"
2148,My 16 year old sons favorite restaurant.,5," November 11, 2013"
2149,"My wife and I took our son and 3 friends to Fogo to celebrate his 13th birthday. They had a blast. Non-stop amazement at the procession and quantity of great food. Fogo waiters kept the meat coming until the boys couldn't eat anymore, and had to flip their coasters over to the red side. Then they had dessert! The molten chocolate cake was fantastic! All had a terrific experience. Then, it was on to the movies. Fogo is an expensive meal for thirteen-year-old boys who are typically happy with pizza, but it was a small group and worth every cent for the smiles on their faces. The birthday boy was very pleased.",5," November 10, 2013"
2150,"I've eaten at several different Fogo locations and I've never been disappointed. Great, lively atmosphere, fantastic food (meat lover's dream, but also a very comprehensive salad buffet). Most times we have gone to celebrate a special occasion, but more and more we are making Fogo the reason to go!",4," November 5, 2013"
2151,A little pricey but food was great!,5," November 5, 2013"
2152,"I've been to the Fogo in Dallas and Brazil and this one in Boston is every bit as good. We were a party of 3 blind people, 2 with Guide Dogs and without sighted companions. The staff knew how to address people who are blind and were extremely attentive to our needs as they were to all patrons. Food was great. Not a place for vegetarians, although they have a spectacular salad bar. Pricey but worth every penny. $85 (including tip) for fixed price meal plus soft drinks and dessert. Makes Midwest Grill in Cambridge look like McDonalds.",5," November 2, 2013"
2153,"I'm vegan, and the others in our group are very carnivorous! With the excellent, fresh and clean salad bar, we all eat well and happy!<br/>The service is terrific because the servers are a team, meaning any one of them can help you with your requests.<br/>We love this place!",5," November 1, 2013"
2154,"Fairly expensive, so just for a special occasion. When you want to splurge. Nice waiters and waitresses.",4," November 1, 2013"
2155,this is our third visit and we continue to enjoy. Salad bar is outstanding and meats are well prepared......sometimes overly spiced but excellent quality,4," November 1, 2013"
2156,"Manage your green/red coaster wisely. After the salad bar, when you switch to the entree plate, the moment you turn your coaster to green, the gauchos are on you at before the coaster hits the table. I suggest you flip the coaster immediately after the first gaucho leaves so you can enjoy the meat that just been delivered, otherwise more gauchos come - one after another, and you lose track of what you have on your plate and don't really get a chance to savor it.<br/><br/>This is a rookie mistake, and by no means a fault of the restaurant or its staff.",4," November 1, 2013"
2157,"we went there to celebrate my sister's birthday, it was a great time for all of us where we felt like plump up pig...we ate so much. we all agreed the picanha, beef ancho, and fraldinha are the best cuts of meet there. the white rice was too dry but the cheese bread is addicting!<br/><br/>the service is outstanding and friendly! will definitely come back again.",5," October 30, 2013"
2158,"The salad bar is very good with too many selections. I would go easy on it or you will nothve room fr theentres which keep on coming, one more interestin than the last. Very good food",4," October 26, 2013"
2159,"outstanding service and food, very attentive staff",5," October 26, 2013"
2160,"Really good food- impressive salad bar, tons of meat options. Casual atmosphere and loud. Great service. A meal for 4 with their cheapest bottle of wine ($60) came to $280 so expect to pay up!",4," October 25, 2013"
2161,"We recently went to Fogo de Chao for my husband's birthday. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about the various cuts of meat, sides, and entrees. My personal favorites was the rare cut of the Filet Mignon; it was absolutely ""melt-in-your-mouth"", To top our evening off a beautifully decorated slice of cake was delivered to us in honor of his birthday. Overall, this restaurant does not disappoint and is a wonderful restaurant with good value for its cost.",4," October 25, 2013"
2162,"Yet to be disappointed by Fogo de Chao. Have now been to 3 different branches with different ambiance at each. Chicago has the grilling slabs of beef on entry. Philadelphia has the old time dignified banker's club quiet elegance, while Boston is more modern but cavernous.<br/>Food is equally good at all three and their wines include some superb Malbecs including a reasonably priced own label.",5," October 20, 2013"
2163,"This was our first experience with the chain and third for Brazilian churrascaria. The waitstaff was superb- very attentive, knowledgeable and polite- like service you would receive at a very high end restaurant. Unexpected since we were basically at a buffet. The salad bar is definitely worth boating about and the gauchos were never heard to come by. We suggest letting them know is you are waiting for a specific choice of meat so they don't all stop by your table. Some of the cuts were a bit overcooked for our liking but there was plenty of meat and gauchos would make many rounds for you to replenish your plate. Everyone goes for the filet, our favorite was the seasoned top round and lambo. Definitely a must try for meat lovers!",4," October 20, 2013"
2164,"if you're into meats, then this is the restaurant is one of the best to go to! different choices of meats in great portion. Gourmet salad bar has fresh goodness that compliment the meat selection. Don't get full off the cheesy bread - it's delicious and can be a meal on it's own!",4," October 18, 2013"
2165,"Before going to Fogo de Chao, I had been to Brazilian steak houses in Brazil, and they do a good job emulating the concept, which is offering various cuts of sizzling delicious meat fresh off the roasting spit. After a large and diverse salad bar, you are offered fully 16 cuts of meat, pork and chicken at the table, cut from skewers before your eyes. The shame of it is that one can only eat so much and there is SO much that could be eaten if you had, let's say three stomachs! This place is great for families, special occasions (office parities etc...). Not the most elegant scene, and a very large venue with a lot of humanity. But for that unique dining experience, I will definitely come back.",4," October 18, 2013"
2166,Nice environment with friendly staff. Meat was prepared well and the servers were quick to arrive at your table.,5," October 18, 2013"
2167,"The food was so yummy and there's tons of it!! Go hungry, for sure. It's fun because it's different. It's worth the price because it's really good food and service. Loved it!",5," October 18, 2013"
2168,"This was my 3rd time at Fogo de Chao, but my 1st time to the one in Boston. Went here for my birthday dinner with family and friends. It exceeded my already high expectations. Absolutely fantastic food, very friendly and attentive staff, and great atmosphere. The room we sat in was too cold at first and the waiter had the heat turned up for us immediately. And I can't say it enough -- FANTASTIC food and wine. I took my boyfriend to the one in DC for his birthday dinner and he raved about it afterward. I recommend this place for special occasions 100%.",5," October 18, 2013"
2169,"Terrific, tasty foods, from meats to salads and seafoods, South American style. Staff friendly and efficient, saw that we got the skewers we wanted brought to the table, all tasty! Thanks for a great experience!",5," October 18, 2013"
2170,"We had reservations for 7:30. Due to bad planing on my part we got there past eight. The girl at the front desk, welcomed us with a smile and said ""no problem right this way"". She gave us a choice of where to sit. The salad bar was amazing! So many choices. The rice beans were very well prepared. You have a choice of just salad bar or the whole shbang!. Which is salad bar and the meats.My husband is a butcher and he loved it. Delicious food very well prepared. Very authentic Brazilian food. I'm not sure what the mashed potatoes are doing on the table.......not a Brazilian thing at all with this kind of meal. You will get your money's worth at this place. There something for everyone in your group. The fish dishes were tasty as well!",5," October 13, 2013"
2171,Can't go wrong with this place if you need to get an overload of uric acid: great meats and friendly service and don't forget your caipirinhas!,4," October 12, 2013"
2172,The food and service at this Brazilian steakhouse were both outstanding. The salad bar was really fabulous with very fresh items galore. They must change it out quite often.<br/><br/>The meat was terrific and the gauchos who bring it to your table are friendly and professional.<br/><br/>While not my choice for everyday dining (too much meat) Fogo de Chao is really fun for a special occasion.,5," October 10, 2013"
2173,"Beautiful restaurant with tablecloth service. Salad bar is stunning with many high end options, including smoked salmon. You need to ""pace"" the meat service (flip coaster to red!) so that it doesn't feel like a barrage of activity and then it is over quickly because everyone is too full. Hard to have conversation with the gauchos always arriving.",3," October 10, 2013"
2174,"Excellent service, great food with a notable selection, fun experience; Best flan I've ever tasted!",5," October 3, 2013"
2175,"Very impressed with both the food and the level of service that all the waiters displayed. Food was extremely prompt once we had flipped our cards to green, especially considering how full the restaurant was.",5," September 21, 2013"
2176,"Potato rolls and no sauces to upset gluten intolerances with AMAZING variety of unlimited proteins. Didn't visit the extensive salad bar to save room for the meat but the high quality, high flavor entrees were outstanding. The team service kept my water glass full and my plate exciting.",5," September 21, 2013"
2177,"I've been several times before in other cities. The meat in Boston and overall experience wasn't special. Wait staff arguing and yelling with each other in Portuguese was particularly off putting. Would go back in Chicago or Las Vegas, not Boston.",3," September 20, 2013"
2178,Costs $50 per person for all you can eat buffet (which is excellent) and top of the line meats. Worth every penny and will be my go to spot for special occasions.,5," September 19, 2013"
2179,#rd time there. Definitely good for groups and you'll never leave hungry. They have a great selection of Capairinhas ad wines as well. Only problem is you're so stuffed you never have room for dessert:(,5," September 19, 2013"
2180,The overall evening was excellent from the time we walked in until we left. Could no have been more attentive. Food was outrageous.,5," September 16, 2013"
2181,"The waitress was horrible, she was not attentive and we had to ask the Bus-Boy for our drinks.<br/>The food was good and no complaints, but the waitress we had was never around. She looked like she didn't want to be there.",3," September 14, 2013"
2182,Just Love this place! The salad bar is amazing! But don't forget to start with the cheese popovers! Absolutely delish! Then the meats start rolling around...OMG! Be sure to come hungry! Very attentive and warm staff. Desserts are nothing to write home about...don't waste the stomach space! WOW...just love the whole experience...only down side is it gets loud as the evening goes on.,5," September 13, 2013"
2183,"The food, the gauchos, and the ambiance are of the highest quality. Their food is always fresh. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. We go as often as humanly possible.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-delicious and gourmet vegetable buffet<br/>-perfectly cooked and seasoned 16 cuts of meat<br/>-warm and inviting atmosphere<br/>-very helpful and personable staff<br/>-amazing wine list and wine cellar<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-running out of stomach space",5," September 10, 2013"
2184,"Fogo de Chao has great food for a fixed price of $49 dollars for dinner. Is all you can eat, so if you decide to try go hungry. They have a great salad bar with a variety of salad, veggies, cheeses which it also includes hot items as rice, black beans, roasted potatoes and fish. The drinks were great as well. We got a complementary dessert for our anniversary dinner. The service was very attentive and polity.",4," September 7, 2013"
2185,"This is a wonderful place for tasting a variety of different meats served by the Gauchos at your table. The salad bar is filled with tempting and tasteful delights, and the challenge is to save space for the meat course. The dessert options are limited, but this assumes you still have the capacity for more food. The wait staff is first rate and are very observant of you wishes. A great and filling eveing.",4," September 6, 2013"
2186,"the concept is a good one and you will never go hungry. Whoever you have to eat a lot, almost to the point of being uncomfortable to feel you get your moneys worth.<br/><br/>worth it every now and then but to go on a continuing basis , ? ?",3," August 31, 2013"
2187,The food and the service were great.,5," August 31, 2013"
2188,Had an overall great experience from the moment we walked into the restaurant.,5," August 30, 2013"
2189,This all you can eat Brazilian Steak house is a great find. The cuts of meat are top choice and cooked any way you would like them. The salad bar alone is a meal in itself. Make sure you go there hungry cause for the price you want to be able to try everything they have to offer. This place is for the true meat eater. The staff and service is a 10 plus.,5," August 30, 2013"
2190,"Sooo much food! Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. This is a very fast-paced scene, so you've got to be ready and on your toes. Love it! Would definitely recommend to a friend, group and company outing. Will be back!",4," August 29, 2013"
2191,This restaurant was so much more than I expected! We went there as a family of 5 . We will be returning for future visits. This restaurant is a must!,5," August 29, 2013"
2192,If you are a meat lover this place is for you!!,3," August 29, 2013"
2193,"The variety of meats was very good, and was always offered promptly, alongside cheese bread puffs, fried bananas, polenta, and mashed potatoes. The salad bar was quite sufficient in its offerings, which also included cheeses, smoked salmon, salami, prosciutto, and a hot fish dish. Quality was very good. The only drawback was that we all felt a sense of urgency to hasten our pace as servers rushed about the dining room with skewered meats and knives in hand.",4," August 27, 2013"
2194,"My friends and I came for restaurant week. We were all impressed with the service and food, lots and lots of food. The only thing lacking was music. It's a great place to go for a special occasion, but make sure you go hungry!!",4," August 27, 2013"
2195,"Love, Love, Love !!!!!! The service was great the people are friendly and treat you like family. The meat selection was great.",5," August 27, 2013"
2196,"Last night our party chose the Regular menu versus Restaurant week. Not sure why they even offered the regular menu because it was impossible to be served anything but the Restaurant week menu. When requesting the lamb chops and tenderloin, the servers just disappeared and never returned. This happened at least 6-7 times. The staff was annoyed we asked for items on the Reg menu (which we paid for). Leaving, we were confronted by panhandlers looking for donations. We politely declined and they chose to call us names and threaten us. The Valet watched. This was right at the bottom of the stairs still under the awning of the restaurant. It was an awful way to end the night.",2," August 27, 2013"
2197,Service was the best thing at this restaurant.,5," August 26, 2013"
2198,Great salad bar. Excellent service.,4," August 25, 2013"
2199,The food is just plain GREAT!!! Will be back again and again.,5," August 23, 2013"
2200,"My experiences with ""all you can eat"" places hasn't been that great - usually the food is lackluster and not exactly fresh. Fogo de Chao was an exception. The restaurant was spotless, the service was prompt, and the food - my god, the food. The salad bar is massive and stocked with things I didn't know existed, and it took all my self-control to not eat three plates of salad.<br/><br/>But nobody goes to a Brazilian steakhouse for the salad, so let's get to the meat. It's perfectly cooked (and you can still specify how you want it cooked). The seasoning complements the meat's flavor instead of overpowering it. It's pricey, but come hungry and you'll get what you paid for.<br/><br/>An added bonus: The delicious cheesy bread on the table? It's gluten free.",5," August 23, 2013"
2201,"Great food and great service to match. I think the regular price tag of $48 is a little over priced, but $40 would be perfect. I definitely will go back. If the price was more reasonable I would go back more frequently. Did I mention that the food was great?",5," August 22, 2013"
2202,"We went for restaurant week and it was AMAZING!!! Food cooked perfectly, so many options, service was tremendous and the drinks over flowing! I ate so much I couldn't eat breakfast the next day from being so full!!!<br/>There were alot of big parties and just couples all having a great time. It really does hit the whole spectrum.. One of my best dining experiences so far this year!!!",5," August 22, 2013"
2203,"I Dined during restaurant week and upon being seated , I was told that there were be a couple of meats excluded from the service Beef Ribs, Lamb chops and Filets, I was a bit disappointed that the only thing consistenly coming around was chicken, crusted pork, sausages, and only 3 cuts of beef over and over again, I did not get any , Prime rib,Top round, Garlic beef etc....Although there was plenty of food and the service was supurb I was just a little dissapointed that your participation in ""restaurnt Week"" was not what I expected. I have been to your restauant 3 times prior for Anniversaries birthdays, special occasions etc...I had always had a great experience just not as much this last time",3," August 22, 2013"
2204,So much food! From salad to steak to the yummy fried polenta you must come in with an empty stomach and an open mouth!,5," August 21, 2013"
2205,Went here for restuarant week- it's a must try! Will not leave hungry. They offered 10 out of the 17 choices from the main menu. Everything was very good- just wished I went lighter on the salad bar for more room on the meats. The salad bar had lots of delicious choices along with dry aged cheese- very good. The brazilian house cocktail worth a try unless you don't like sweet drinks try the brazilian beer instead.,4," August 21, 2013"
2206,Amazing meats! The meat was so flavorful and tender you almost didn't need a knife! Servers were very attentive and energetic.,5," August 21, 2013"
2207,My friends and I picked the perfect place to celebrate my friend's birthday. The food was amazing and excellent service!,5," August 20, 2013"
2208,"I had never been to this style of steak house before, in retrospect, I should have realized that it was a large corporate entity. The uniforms, the rehearsed 'schtick', the enormous staff. The atmosphere was very energetic but in an almost distracting way. Waiters, meat carvers, back waters, food runners... . prepare to be approached by staff every few minutes. The bar area was extremely loud, slate floors and walls make for poor acoustics. No bev naps under our wine glasses and bar staff was too busy to close our bar tab so I assumed it was transferred to our dinner tab. The food itself, was good.<br/><br/>An interesting experience if you've never been to this style of restaurant but not one I would repeat.",2," August 20, 2013"
2209,"After being strongly recommended by my sister, My boyfriend and I were excited to discover that Fogo de Chao was participating in Restaurant week. Our dining experience exceeded our expectations. The service was very friendly without being too overbearing and it was obvious the waiters were trained well. The whole restaurant was clean which is hard to be given their concept of dining. Most importantly, the steak was incredible--perfectly cooked and seasoned. I loved how no matter which meat was served, you could always get a piece cut off for you that was well-done, medium-well, medium, rare, etc. We will definitely be coming back!",5," August 18, 2013"
2210,"I really wanted to like this place. I heard soooo many good things about it. The meat weren't as hot and fresh when it got to our table. It was a hit or miss... When it was fresh hot, it was pretty good. Other than that ehh. I left the place feeling okay and not buffet full if you know what I mean... haha but anyways the food really got boring after a while it was the same thing over and over. I personally think it is a very small selection. I went during dinner time. Fresh though. Maybe Brazilian food is just not for me. It just tasted like salt. Things were a bit salty in my opinion. The atmosphere is good and so was the service. I definitely wouldn't come back here for the price.",2," August 18, 2013"
2211,I enjoyed the night at this establishment. The food was prepared very well. The atmosphere was very nice as well as all the staff.<br/>The meats were cooked very well and will melt in your mouth!,5," August 16, 2013"
2212,"As long as you have the green side of the card up, the waiters will keep bringing all sorts of steaks, chops, and the like to you, so this is really a meat lover's paradise. Although it would be very easy to overdo on the quantity, that is not a foregone conclusion, and my family and I really enjoyed lots of variety of meat and ended the evening feeling full but not stuffed to the gills. All the wait staff were attentive and solicitous, and my family (who do not speak much English and no Portugese) felt at ease throughout the evening.",5," August 16, 2013"
2213,"This is and expensive all you can eat with fair food quality, not a dining experience. Be a good place for the ""guys or gals"" nite out, sitting around drinking and eating and drinking and eating some more. Fine dining iit is not. At $45 per person for food only, expensice too. Tried, sounded good, never again. If you want to eat 40# of beef and such for $45 this is for you.",2," August 10, 2013"
2214,"Probably some of the best food I've ever had. Everything including even the salad bar was awesome! Great atmosphere, wait staff was supurb, and obviously the steak was some if not the best I've ever had.",5," August 7, 2013"
2215,"This place offers all you can est meat and salad. The food and service are excellent. If you love meat, you'll like this place.",5," August 4, 2013"
2216,"They didn't get the OpenTable reservation? Enjoyed it, but experience was sort of a higher end, all you can eat buffet.",3," August 4, 2013"
2217,"I took my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday at Fogo de Chao. While making a reservation for the event, I put a little note, saying it's a birthday. Then I forgot about the note, because we all were excited about getting together and celebrating and about the great food, lots of choices of food and drinks. So after we finished all the tasty meats and the salads that the bar offers and could barely move, our waiter showed up with a cake!! It was unforgettable! Even I was surprised! I mean I know I need a pill for my memory, but they remembered and it was such a nice gesture! We have so many wonderful memories with this place, that tonight, while looking for a dinner spot, there was not even a doubt that it's going to be Fogo De Chao.",5," August 3, 2013"
2218,"Very nice experience with good food and good service. Have been to others in this chain. Boston location is less energetic and more easy going than other locations, but larger site and still the same great food and experience.",4," August 3, 2013"
2219,"Went here for a birthday dinner, and Fogo did not disappoint. Their servers were friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious. I will definitely come back again!",5," August 2, 2013"
2220,"While this churrascaria might be pricey, it's the closest thing you can get to good Brazilian churrascaria. Of course nothing beats the original establishments in Sao Paulo, but will pass. They are missing: Brazilian beer, chicken hearts, farofa, salgadinhas, etc. Loved the picanha and contra filet, but there's only so much meat a girl can eat. This is a good place for carnivores.",4," August 2, 2013"
2221,Can easily over-eat but the food was of great quality. Definitely worth a try if you've never been to a Brazilian Steak House before. The experience is part of the meal. Even the employees showed passion about working there. Definitely go the Flan route for dessert.,4," August 2, 2013"
2222,"If you love meat, this is your place. It is fun, upbeat and great for getting people together. You hav ego ask for the special meats like lamb chops and ribs but service and food is good. The only criticism is the sides come with the meal and they were bananas and mashed potatoes. I was craving something green although they have a substantial salad bar",3," August 2, 2013"
2223,The meat was well seasoned and well prepared. The servers knew just how to cut meat from the skewers to give me a medium rare price of meat. And the skewers just kept coming. The salad bar however was pretty average. But you do not go to go to a Brazilian steakhouse for a salad bar so it should not detract from the experience.,4," July 30, 2013"
2224,"This was my first Brazilian steakhouse dining experience having never been interested in all-you-can eat meat dining. However, after this experience, I will definitely be going back. They served just the right amount for each type of meat. The salad bar was stocked well so you could find anything and everything to compliment the main entree. Had the best flan I've ever tasted (there was no ""eggy"" after taste!) and accommodated our request to sit next to the window even though that section of the restaurant wasn't open yet when we got there. Overall, an excellent dining experience. We didn't even bat an eyelash when we saw the bill because it was well worth it. They definitely made it feel like a special occasion.",5," July 29, 2013"
2225,"The most notable was the service, I have never been to a restaurant with better service than you. Wonderful experience!!",5," July 27, 2013"
2226,"We were there to celebrate our son's 18th birthday. It was festive, fun and different enough to feel special. The quality of the meat was excellent and the sides and salad bar also were very fresh and tasty. The room is attractive and, despite being very lively and busy, quiet enough to have a conversation. We all thought we would like to return soon.",5," July 26, 2013"
2227,"A Carnivore's Dream! Always wanted to try and was not disappointed. Excellent salad bar and service, our favorite meat was the lamb but all were very good. The cheese bread was addictive, papaya cream dessert provided a nice finish.",5," July 26, 2013"
2228,"I have been to Fogo in 4 cities. This location was a disappointment. Not as good and not worth the $48.50. I have loved the meat at the other locations. I had really been looking forward to this Birthday dinner and it was not up to par. I was planning to go to the one in Atlanta next month. Now, I'm not sure. If I'm spending $150 for 2 for dinner I want the meal to be exceptional. This one wasn't.",3," July 20, 2013"
2229,"Delicious and that staff was great. It was my fiance's 30th and he doesn't like sweets, so the wait staff brought out a decorated plate of bread with a strawberry and candle as an app. Also the food and drinks are amazing.",5," July 18, 2013"
2230,"This place gives you top quality, all-you-can-eat meat with unlimited premium side dishes. Also, the service is like no other. Everyone is so nice and goes out of their way to make your dining experience the best thing that has ever happened to you.",5," July 18, 2013"
2231,Great Food and Great Management to keep the staff so motivated.,5," July 17, 2013"
2232,This was our first visit to this location but we've been to several fogo de chaos in different states and the food at this location was about the same as others and the service very friendly. Did a really nice job with the decoration however tables are a bit too close to each other.,3," July 14, 2013"
2233,"As a repeat customer of the Fogo chain, we again enjoyed the service and food. Food and service has been better at other Fofos but was still good although waiters needed to be prompted to bring out some of the selections like lamb or ribs. The food is pretty consistent with other locations but the setting is much better than other Fogos. Very elegant and inviting to linger.dwfinitely worth a repeat visit when in town and a strong recommendation for a relatively new place.",5," July 14, 2013"
2234,"There was a superb and varied steak selection, accompanied by an amazing salad bar with a wide range of food on offer including asparagus, black beans, and artichokes. Best pao de queijo we've had, but the restaurant needs to think of offering the classic Braziilian desserts, such as brigadeiro and quindim.",5," July 13, 2013"
2235,"The service is great (warm and welcoming), the room is beautiful, the food is very good, and the whole ""gauchos slicing meats at tableside"" is great fun.",4," July 13, 2013"
2236,"Loudy, messy, disorganized, overpriced. 50$ per person, but drinks are not included. My son (6 yers old) ate just a couple of things, like kids usuall do, but still paid 25$. Unless you are able to ingurgitatemassive amounts of meat in 10 minutes, you will find yourself full very soon and will stop eating, way before all the types of meat that you were supposed to try will be erved to you. My wife was full in 5 minutes, my son in 3 min, but still it was 50 bucks per person. The salad/ appetizer bar is terrible. Quality of food is very poor. The service was disorganized and messy. The place was extremely loudy. It was just a big disappointment and a waste of money.",1," July 12, 2013"
2237,Come hungry so you get value for your $.,4," July 11, 2013"
2238,Not even 30 seconds after turning our token over to green were we bombarded with delicious cuts of various meats. Every cut tasted different yet delicious. The sides and salad bar was just as amazing. Make sure you go extra hungry and plan on leaving uncomfortably stuffed. My favorites were the filet and picanha.,5," July 5, 2013"
2239,"My husband and I stopped in for dinner as this restaurant has been on our ""to do"" list for a while now. We were pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing. All the top cuts of steaks and chicken and ribs. The salad bar was sooooo good and there was so much to choose from. We have already told many friends and family members and hope to visit again soon... maybe for a special occasion or just a night out!",5," July 5, 2013"
2240,"Fogo de Chao is a consistently good chain, but the new Boston location is extra special because of all the Brazilians who work there. Don't get me wrong. The food at Fogo de Chao Kansas City is great, but the experience is much more authentic when many of the servers are Brazilian. We loved the salad bar, the meat, the mashed potatoes, the polenta sticks and the bananas. The little cheese breads (pao de queijo) are in a class by themselves! On our travels, if we see there's a Fogo de Chao in town, we eat there! I wish we had one in NYC.",5," July 5, 2013"
2241,We went for lunch. The food was excellent. Service was very attentive. We always had full water glasses and sides on the table. The staff was great at making sure we got the type of meat we were looking for. Everything at the salad bar was fresh and delicious.,5," July 4, 2013"
2242,"This was the perfect choice for a special occasion dinner. I decided to come here for my boyfriend's birthday. Every single dish was delicious. I asked one waiter for a lamb dish (for some reason I was really craving it), and less than five minutes later three separate lamb choices arrived. Every single person working there is friendly, quick, and professional. We had an amazing time, and I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone looking for a romantic evening, or, as my boyfriend put it: ""This would also make an awesome place for great night out with the guys."" The food and service are beyond what you pay for. It was incredible.",5," July 1, 2013"
2243,"Fogo de Chao gives you the quality and quantity that every diner dreams about. It also adds variety, its a meat lover's paradise offering several different cuts of beef - filet, sirloin, round, chicken, sausage. The salad bar is also quite nice and included in the pricing. So you really get a chance to try a lot of things and by the time desert menu comes, you will likely not be able to eat another morsel. That's part of the downside of eating in a Churascaria style -- no mortal can pace himself.",3," June 30, 2013"
2244,This fabulous restaurant is right across the street from Copley Square. The salad bar was amazing. I would have been happy with just that. But then the Goucho dressed staff started bringing the 16 rotisseried cuts of meat. We found everything perfectly seasoned. My favorite was the lamb. My husbands favorite was the flank steak Even my fussy eater 8 year old was happy. My only complaint is actually an open table mistake. It gave it a $$ price guide meaning under $30 per entree. It was not that reasonable. Price was $48.50 a person with my 8 year old at half price. My husband thought it was worth it. But I was a little upset to have to pay full price for an 11 year old. We are definitely going back our next trip to Boston!!!,5," June 27, 2013"
2245,We ate at a Fogo de Chao a few years ago on vacation and had the opportunity to try them again as their restaurant was located right across the street at Fairmont Copley Plaza. This one in Boston was good as was the one in DC that we tried before. Fun evening with the meat coming to our table.....as much as we wanted.....you say when and how much. Servers were pleasant.....fun evening.....salad bar also very good and live the hot rolls that are served on abundance.,5," June 27, 2013"
2246,"This was my second time at Fogo de Chao. First time was with Mom for Mother's Day. We filled our plates with so much salad we hardly ate any meats -- no room for it! Second time I had a small salad and linguica, pork ribs, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, beef w/garlic, rib eye, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, baby lamb and baby lamp chops. The beef was absolutely wonderful, especially the filet mignon! I loved the lamb, too.<br/><br/>The meal also includes delicious popovers (that are gluten free, by the way). There some side dishes of corn fries, mashed potatoes and PLAINTAINS TO DIE FOR and each of these get refilled when you empty the dish.<br/><br/>The service is friendly and very attentive in an upscale space.",4," June 26, 2013"
2247,"The food and service was excellent, my only concern was the salad bar(which was excellent) but therre were no signs or names of all the different cheeses,cold cuts, even some of the various salads. I noticed a lot of people were puzzled and asked other diners what was what.",5," June 23, 2013"
2248,The restaurant looks fantastic with a very good ambiance. Salad bar was excellent as well as the side dishes but the meats were overcooked. Overall a nice place to hang out with friends for a nice Brazilian barbecue experience.,4," June 22, 2013"
2249,DELICIOUS food and AMAZING service. So very happy with the whole experience overall. For meat eaters this place is a must!,5," June 21, 2013"
2250,Food was excellent and abundant. Waiter was very attentive,4," June 21, 2013"
2251,"The service was good, the wait staff we're attentive and even amidst a very busy hour I felt we received ample attention. Unfortunately the food, especially the meat, was incredibly salty. Salty to a level that it become a point of discussion as we tried to enjoy the dinner. It was joked that we felt like we'd eaten a salt lick after dinner.<br/>I will note that the setup is conducive for big groups.",2," June 16, 2013"
2252,"This restaurant exceeds our expectations every time. The staff are highly trained, attentive and friendly. The food, from the top notch selections at the salad bar to the dessert menu, is delicious. The hour drive (each way) is worth it every time. Valet parking is available, which is wonderful especially in bad weather. I forget this is a national restaurant (we've been to several around the country) because they fit so easily into the Boston dining scene.",5," June 16, 2013"
2253,Addicted to the Picanha! Everybody there is very service-oriented and nice.,4," June 16, 2013"
2254,"This is a fun place for a birthday, graduation or family event. The salad bar is well stocked with exceptionally fresh ingredients, appealingly presented and frequently replenished. Unlike many Brazilian style ""rodizio"" restaurants we have visted, the grilled meats were tender and grilled to perfection, with no salty marinades to mask a lack of flavor. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, and when it was noticed that our party of four was especially fond of the cheesy polenta fries--plates of them fresh from the fryer were brought to our table so frequently that we had to beg them to stop. The only thing missing was fresh fruit--we would have liked to see a larger variety offered as part of the salad bar.",4," June 15, 2013"
2255,Not something you could do too frequently but great for a special occasion. Took some family members here for an early Father's Day dinner and everyone was impressed. Service was top notch and food was amazing. New favorite restaurant!,5," June 14, 2013"
2256,Food especially the beef was exceptional along with the service. Bit on the expensive side but well worth it.,5," June 12, 2013"
2257,"Who doesn't love meat on a stick - ok vegetarians maybe but as I myself eat a fair amount of vegetarian meals - I was quickly taken over by the smells and sights of grilled meat on a stick as the guachos came around the table again and again offering their freshly grilled meat to carve off to my delight. Our table was having so much fun trying the different types that we quickly forgot about the 3 hot sides they offered (garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and plaintains) as well the other hot sides to choose from (rice, beans, roasted potatoes and another regional dish).<br/><br/>Add to all that - the ginormous salad bar which is one of the best and freshest salad bars I have ever seen - I may just need to go back before I head home!",5," June 11, 2013"
2258,Delicious steak buffet with plenty of side dishes available. Long wine list. Great decor.,5," June 7, 2013"
2259,If I could give it 10 stars I would. Best graduation dinner ever!,5," June 7, 2013"
2260,"My husband and I dined here on a recent trip to Boston. We were seated promptly, and had a waiter at our table almost immediately. He was very informative. The cheese rolls, salad bar, side dishes and meats were excellent. The salad bar was quite large and had many great offerings. The waitstaff was outstanding! They made sure our sides were always replenished and they made sure we got the meats we wanted and that they were cooked to our liking. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Boston!",5," June 7, 2013"
2261,"Had a great time...food, service and hospitality were all excellent. a fun place that i would highly recommend",5," June 5, 2013"
2262,"It is a unique dining experience, a wonderful help yourself buffet and a never ending supply of roasted/ grilled meat of all types. The beef and the lamb was outstanding. The lunch price is very competitive and excellent value..<br/>If you want to eat there, you should keep your appetite for that occasion.<br/>We all loved the place.",5," June 3, 2013"
2263,"The salad bar was pretty standard, but the meats were fantastic. The top sirloin melts in your mouth. Service is very fast and they all work together so you don't have to hunt for your particular server when you need something. The one downside is that even when you flip your card to red, the regular waitstaff still arrives at the table every 2 minutes to check on things. This might stem out of a fear of neglecting a table because there is no assigned server. With all of the attention, it is hard to settle down into the meal with those you came to enjoy it with. Otherwise, the meal was great!",4," May 26, 2013"
2264,Very expensive but the food is good.,3," May 25, 2013"
2265,"It was our first time at a Fogo restaurant, although we have been to other south American steakhouse in the past, and the Boston Fogo was outstanding. We were a group of 7, and we all found the food extremely tasty - from the salad and side dish bars and from the skewers that were constantly being brought around. The variety was excellent. Service was friendly and we didn't feel rushed. Dessert was also delicious.",5," May 25, 2013"
2266,"The sala bar is great, the meats are good but not great.",3," May 25, 2013"
2267,"My first visit to FDC and loved it! From first hello the staff is warm &amp; welcoming. We started with a signature caipirinha and WOW super good - you will not find any better in Boston. There is something for everyone here - salads, chicken, lamb and of course different cuts of steak. We ate it all, drank a nice affordable bottle of Pinot Noir and topped it with dessert and a pretty good cappuccino. Its a great location overlooking Copley and easy spot to meet up.",5," May 22, 2013"
2268,After my son's graduation from BU we took him to this restaurant to celebrate. It is a perfect place to take two 22 year olds that are always hungry! You can sit there for hours and just keep eating. Food was great!,4," May 19, 2013"
2269,We chose graduation night to come to Fogo de Chao for our first time. It was exremely busy. It took a while to get our drinks ordered but once we started the service the food came thick and fast. Everything was cooked really well &amp; the staff were very knowledable.,4," May 18, 2013"
2270,"I have been to Fogo in Philly and loved it. The salad bar is much more than just salad and I could make a meal out of it alone. Then the meat comes, and it is outstanding. The way I see it, If I'm going to pay $49 for a steak at Capital Grille, why not pay $49 at Fogo and get a whole outstanding meal? Lamb, chicken, beef, all delicious and cooked perfectly.<br/>Unfortunately, the dining room is crowded and very noisy. People are walking up to the salad bar, servers are rushing around with skewers of meat, and busboys are setting up tables. I could barely hear my server listing the beer selections, which should have been written on a menu in the first place. The service was also unacceptably slow for a restaurant of this price.",3," May 18, 2013"
2271,"There are plenty of choices of rotating meats, with many very juicy and delicious - each person at our table had a different favorite, with the lamb T bone being our favorite overall. You will absolutely not leave hungry. If you choose, there is also an extensive salad bar to get you started or provide a breather between meat courses. Very good overall.",4," May 17, 2013"
2272,"Not much to say here except come hungry. Hands down the best cuts offered here, and I tried everything, are the beef ribs, lamb chops, leg of lamb, rib eye, and the house special sirloin. The other cuts were all above average including the filet mignon, top sirloin, and bottom sirloin. If you don't have big stomach try to enjoy the first 5 listed here ranked in order of my favorites. Second tip salad bar was good but nothing to write home about, stick to the meats as much as possible and maybe enjoy a small selection of cured meats, smoked salmon, and a vegetable side of choice (asparagus, peppers, brussel sporouts, etc.)",4," May 16, 2013"
2273,"I'm a meat lover so I was really looking forward to a meal at Fogo. Our server gave us the basics. Unfortunately, she did not tell us to ask her for specific cuts or the optional sides.<br/><br/>I liked the Ancho, the Filet and the Lamb chops, although we never saw the Leg of Lamb. The Picanha was a little salty. Try the garlic seasoned.The Lombo was a little dry. I did not care for the Alcatra or the Fraldinha, which was a little tough to chew. The Pork Ribs were okay, but weak compared with Southern BBQ.<br/><br/>I nibbled at the Salad Bar. The Caesar Salad was fine. Only one other bread. Loved the sliced cheeses. The bacon was rubbery.<br/><br/>I tried the Xingu Brazilian Black Beer which was fabulous.<br/><br/>I will return, now that I'm a seasoned veteran.",3," May 12, 2013"
2274,"We celebrated my daughters birthday here, and the experience was great for everyone. I pleaded with everyone before we got there to pace themselves since it is ""all you can eat"", but before we knew it the food was just everywhere- excellent food.<br/>Great walkable location(which you will need to do after all this food), freindly attentive staff, great responsive service, never had an empty drink glass, and there was almost (I hate to say it) too much food! the salad bar is very extensive, desserts are excellent too! They brough over a dessert flan with a Happy birthday written on the plate for my daughter. Its pricey, but totally worth it for a special occasion.",5," May 11, 2013"

2276,"Great ambiance, delicious food, knowledgable staff.",5," May 11, 2013"
2277,"My dining experience was good overall . I went there with friends and family to celebrate my graduation. Service was excellent and attentive, food was ok for the price we paid. It's an expensive buffet could be good for people who can eat a lot. For me personally I couldn't eat for the amount I paid..<br/>Very nice decor too .",4," May 11, 2013"
2278,"Texas de Brazil is really a favorite so we were really excited to see there was a similar restaurant in our State, but what a disappointment when we went to Fogo de Chao - six of us were set for a nice celebratory dinner, and although it was nice to be together, at a round table, the food was institutional and the service was very interuptive even while obeying the rules of the restaurant: green for service red for no service. The other down side was that even if you just get the salad option, it is only $10 less - that really doesn't say much about the quality of meat ... Sad to say, that the only positive was the valet service, which we found out was outsourced - no surprise there.",1," May 10, 2013"
2279,Execellent food and very prompt service,5," May 7, 2013"
2280,amazing choices - too many to choose from. Be sure to go when you are very hungry and have plenty of time to relaxingly enjoy.,5," May 5, 2013"
2281,"The food is good, but not spectacular.",3," May 1, 2013"
2282,"I was disappointed that the best meats were very infrequently served and the lowest cost meats were served on a 5:1 ratio. What I ate was over-cooked and very tough meat. For the price this is an extremely over-priced restaurant even though the service was good.<br/><br/>Although I was very disappointed,I might try this chain of restaurants again, as I refuse to believe the food is as bad as it was during this visit.",2," April 28, 2013"

2285,Great food and drink. All the different types of meat you could want.,4," April 24, 2013"
2286,"Good, but not worth the price. Meats are all good, salad bar is a bit mundane, but overall for that kind of money, you are better off at a good steak place.",3," April 24, 2013"
2287,Took my son and some of his college friends for dinner. Pricey but with 4 boys they definately ate enough to justify the price. All the meat was very good - tender - and well prepared. Service is very attentive. One issue was that one person in our party is a vegetarian -- and they charge $25 for trip to the salad bar. Come one - get real. If you love meat -- you will not be disappointed. Would return again - but not with a vegetarian!,4," April 24, 2013"
2288,Superb food and excellent customer service! Exceed the expectations :),5," April 20, 2013"
2289,An Excellent restaurant overall. The only complaint was that the wait staff was very attentive occasionally and then other times it took a long time to get someone's attention. It felt like they were moving around but were purposely avoiding eye contact so as not to have to really do something.,4," April 17, 2013"
2290,Good place for a fun occasion --- a few of us enjoyed it just as much even though we did not eat any meat!,5," April 14, 2013"
2291,I have been to Baltimore and Boston locations both outstanding for food and service I eat out four of seven days a week by far the best they do it right I recommend Fogo de Chao to everyone,5," April 13, 2013"

2293,"Very enjoyable experience, wait staff were terrific, food was excellent!",5," April 13, 2013"
2294,"As a big fan of Brazilian BBQ/Steakhouses I was quite excited when I heard that Fogo de Chao was opening in Boston as I had gone to one in Chicago. However, I was somewhat dissapointed on my first visit last week. Given the higher than typical prices for fare of this sort($48/pp), I anticipated the meat quality to be top notch which it wasnt. Most cuts were chewy and not tender. The service was frenetic and over the top. In fact, my partners wine glass was wisked away when we opted not to get a second bottle despite there being a few more sips remaining. On the plus side, the salad bar was quite nice, fresh, with a great selection. The ""hot"" bar had rice and beans,but no brazilian dishes that I have found at other similiar restaurants",2," April 13, 2013"
2295,"Excellent everything, however, a bit pricey for me.",5," April 12, 2013"
2296,"Excellent food, excellent service. The Valet service was even outstanding! Welcome to Boston.",4," April 6, 2013"
2297,"Delicious cuts of meat. If you can, save room for dessert, I don't know how I managed but I needed something sweet and the cr√®me br√ªl√©e absolutely hit the spot.",5," April 4, 2013"
2298,Nice service! The atmosphere is quite good. The food is diverse though the meat is a little bit salty. Overall it is a great restaurant.,4," April 4, 2013"
2299,Best salad bar anywhere and always great service.,5," March 31, 2013"
2300,"Food was great. The service came to our table probably once every 5 minutes.<br/><br/>The host staff was pleasant, and the atmosphere was energetic. Good for some occasions, bad if you want some privacy or want to have a longer conversation.<br/><br/>We noticed several groups there (upwards of 10-15), made up of tables pushed together. Our section was a little louder than I'd want, with tables pretty close together, although comfortable. This location is next to a hotel, in a great location next to public transportation.",4," March 31, 2013"
2301,the salad bar was great..enjoyed that more than the meat course...,4," March 31, 2013"
2302,"THis was a complete surprise. I had no idea what to expect, but was lured by an Easter advertisement indicating that Chago would be serving 15 different kinds of meat on that day ala the Brazilian way. The atmosphere was fabulous and a must for special occasions. Beautiful flowers, happy and accommodating waiters, and a great hot and cold salad bar. When we sat dow a waiter came over and very carefully shared how the meal would be served and how we were to use our green and red cards. Green for o. Our cards were green all afternoon. We had some lovely pieces of meat on spits. Pork chops in parmesan crust, filet mignon to die for, lamb chops that must be ordered always, chicken in bacon and so much more. A really happy time. Great for famili",5," March 31, 2013"
2303,"Salad bar is great. Meat is good, although the servers tend to splatter as they serve, so don't wear white. Waiter was very aggressive. Almost felt as we were being verbally assaulted as we sat down, since before we were even seated in our chairs (and before we had menus) he was requesting a drink order. He also tried to up-sell on our wine choice. Atmosphere very casual. Definitely don't go for a special occasion. But it's not a casual night out either, as the price-point is a bit high.",3," March 29, 2013"
2304,"This was our first dining experience at Fogo de Chao. The food was very good, service was attentive and friendly. Looking forward to dining there again!",4," March 29, 2013"
2305,"Not as good as the location in Minnesota, but great food overall. Staff really needs to step up the facial interaction. Hardly anyone smiled except for the actual Brazilian servers. Must be in the their blood. Everyone should smile and be enthusiastic like Brazilians are. I still love this place, so I will be back.",4," March 29, 2013"
2306,The staff was extremely attentive and worked as a team. We had several servers check in on us throughout our meal and we never wanted for anything. The salad bar was incredible with many choices and every meat selection was delicious. We also enjoyed a bottle of wine with our meal. The list was extensive and there was a price range to fit most budgets. We had a thoroughly enjoyable evening at Fogo de Chao.,4," March 28, 2013"
2307,"This was a fun experience with excellent food - the waiter and reviews I read said to avoid filling up on the salad bar - good advice!<br/><br/>Also, almost everything is GLUTEN free including the popovers they serve as bread! They greeted us with a list of allergens so my daughter with Celiac's could eat safely!!!!<br/><br/>Maybe next time we will have room for dessert....",5," March 27, 2013"
2308,"Having been to Fogo de Chao in other major metros in the US I was surprised to see that it had opened a restaurant close to me in Boston. I went knowing that I would be getting great service and great food as per my experience from the other Fogo de Chao's I've visited but I found the level of quality of the staff and the food at Boston's Fogo to surpass the levels that I'd experienced elsewhere. The thoughtfulness and attentiveness of all the staff, the quality of the food being offered and the decor and lighting of the Boston restaurant gave me my best dining experience of the last 18 months. I had brought some notoriously hard to please people with me and they were truly delighted with the experience also.",5," March 26, 2013"
2309,was there for lunch... the food was outstanding as was the service... and atmosphere... will certainly dine there again,5," March 25, 2013"

2311,"We love that Fogo has opened in Boston and this was our 3rd experience at the Boston location (have been to Fogo in Philly, Orlando, and one other city). At first the service was horrible, but after I spoke to one of the waiters it was like we were royalty! I appreciate that when something is wrong and is brought to their attention they make every effort to fix it! We will be back again!",4," March 23, 2013"
2312,Very good meal and service. total confusion when we went to check in. Asked for name and reservation 3 times by 3 different people,4," March 23, 2013"

2314,"I've eaten in many churascarria's in Brazil, and find the U.S. counterparts lacking. This was an exception. The salad bar is exceptional and the meat selections are terrific. I've eaten here three times and have not been disappointed. It makes a great impression for special occasions or business events. Great for groups as everyone eats at their own pace. I love this place. The price is high but so is the quality. Try weekday lunch, same quality/quantity at a much reduced price.",5," March 21, 2013"
2315,"If you like Brazilian steak houses, you'll love it here. The food and service are top notch and it was a great experience. Would definitely go again.",4," March 20, 2013"
2316,"Nice atmosphere. All the wait staff seemed to be originally from Brazil- but spoke perfect English and could describe the various selections in great detail. They were incredibly energetic - sprinting back and forth from the fire to the table and back again.<br/><br/>There were countless servings of different cuts of meats, chicken and pork. Seemed like and endless supply and it was all delicious. The salad bar was very big - with all the usual suspects. Brazillian specialty drinks from the bar were excellent !<br/><br/>Overall a great place for a special occasion. A bit expensive when you consider the value ($50/pp) - can't imagine most people consume $50 worth of steak, etc..",5," March 19, 2013"
2317,Best Brazilian around! Amazing and delicious cuts of meat...great salad bar!!!,5," March 16, 2013"
2318,"It was too cold inside, and it seemed that their heating did not work, by the time the place was full, it got warmer.",4," March 15, 2013"
2319,"I have been to several Brazilian steak houses over the years including other Fogo restaurants, and I must say that either I'm not terribly impressed by the formula and value of the meal, or that this particular restaurant does not add much to step above the pack besides a nice urban decor. Food-wise, the meats are generally average, rather fatty. the portions are really thinned out, and you have to beg for seconds or more. Total portion is less than a full steak in a regular steak house. The salad bar is excellent in variety and quality. As to service, you can't but feel pushed to finish and leave the table to others if you're not going to order again... Overall, a nice curiosity, but not a regular restaurant for us.",3," March 12, 2013"
2320,"Fogo has the best meat in Boston, the service is super friendly, but beware to get really full, so go on an empty stomach so you can taste all the beef varieties. The salad bar is awesome, has a lot of options, even if you are a vegetarian, the salad bar will be more than enough to fill you up.<br/><br/>The Caipirinhas are great to, I specially like the strawberry one.",5," March 10, 2013"
2321,"Salad bar was outstanding, but dinner not as impressive. There are a lot of varieties of meat available, but after a short while the variety became meat overload. The price per person was close to $50.00 (for salad and all you can eat dinner with sides)--how much can one possibly eat??? Overall, seemed a bit expensive for the actual food my party consumed. People who enjoy a lot of meat would like this restaurant.",4," March 9, 2013"
2322,Fun! Very good salad bar if all that meat is not your thing.,4," March 8, 2013"
2323,This restaurant was fantastic. I highly recommend it!!! Superb!,5," March 8, 2013"
2324,A carnivore's dream! Service is top shelf and you better be hungry as quantity abounds,5," March 7, 2013"
2325,Great place to enjoy Brazilian churrasco perfectly done and at an unbeatable price. Totally try the caipirinhas- they are outstanding.,4," March 5, 2013"
2326,"This was our second trip to this establishment and it was amazing. The meats are delicious, there was one which was a tad salty but never the less delicious. The wine list is great especially if sharing a bottle. The salad bar is good but nothing special. The description of the salad bar on line leaves you with this idea in your head of something grand but it is just mediocre.",4," March 3, 2013"
2327,"When booking the OpenTable reservation, I made a request that they do something special for my Dad's 73rd birthday. I never said anything else and they were amazing. My Dad ordered creme brulee and his plate was decorated beautifully with words in sauces, candle and lots of whipped cream (my Dad's favorite). Our server was incredibly attentive and put in a special order of chicken breast for my mother as she doesn't eat bacon and all other chicken served was wrapped in bacon. We were beyond pleased with the whole experience and can't wait to go back!",5," March 3, 2013"
2328,"It was a very pleasant evening. The food is very, very good and the service makes it feel special. The salad bar is amazing!",4," March 3, 2013"
2329,"Fogo is a meat-fest. Bring your big-boy eating pants &amp; come on in! Be prepared... since it's technically an 'all you can eat,' you will get all kinds of people. Some dressed to the nines, some looking like trailer trash. And the dining room is very well lit, so you cannot avoid the temptation to people watch. It tends to be VERY loud, too. Especially on weekend nights. It makes it hard to have a good conversation with a party larger than 4. Still, the meat is always tasty and the salad bar is great, too. Service is friendly and efficent, though bar service tends to be slow.",4," March 2, 2013"
2330,"Having dined at various Brazilian bbq restaurants in the Boston area for years, we heard of Fogo opening at Copley and jumped at the bit. I highly recommend making reservations, we did for a Saturday night and the place was hopping. The decor is nice, white tablecloth setting, high ceilings adorn the dining area. Once seated, your main waiter describes how they operate: green side of the coaster is ""GO"", red side is ""STOP I can't take anymore!"" You enjoy the large salad bar first, then the waiters with the meats on skewers parade around, there are 16 meats to choose from, each one delicious. Loved their signature prime meats, nothing was dry, all moist and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend. Didn't try the desserts though.",4," March 2, 2013"
2331,"My boyfriend and I have very different ideas of what's for dinner, honey. He is into meats, I am into fish, he is into spicy food, I am into a salad with a dressing on a side, he is into fatty desserts, I am into fresh fruits, etc...We'll never fight for food, which is a good thing. Another good thing is that we found Fogo De Chao, which serves all both of us are craving and so we both enjoy our time there very much. Every time. I just wish the waiters didn't forget to bring the drinks because sometimes we finish our food before they do.",4," March 1, 2013"
2332,Our son just turned thirteen and wanted his birthday dinner celebrated at Fogo de Chao. He definitely will hold great memories of his 13th birthday for years to come. The food and service was top notch. This is a restaurant you must try. Our reservation was for 5:30 pm and we didn't leave until 8:00 pm!,5," March 1, 2013"
2333,"It is a great Steakhouse for Americans and other non-Brazilians. But for people that know the quality of a Brazilian steakhouse, it's way too expensive for what they offer. All salad bar food was good. Half of the meat we ate was good to. But the other half was blend. Amazingly frustrating Picanha, which is supposed to be the best meat served. In 30 years, it's the 1st time I have to add salt in my barbecue meet. So not Brazilian.",3," February 23, 2013"
2334,"Good Restaurant, food was ok. i was expecting way more brazilian food and different tastes but was ok. Only thing i really did not like there was: We had to wait up to 30 minutes to have the table even having a reservation made. Another thing, it is expensive, very exctually.",3," February 23, 2013"
2335,"Great food, service, and drinks!",5," February 23, 2013"
2336,Very salty food. I am a fan of various meats but all of it was so salty that it masked the natural taste of the meat. I will not be returning to a Fogo de Chao.,1," February 17, 2013"
2337,"Great food, but very, very pricey for what it is",3," February 17, 2013"
2338,"Experience was as expected. Service was very good, food was good but nothing special. Based on menu descriptions on line &amp; on menu, we had high expectations. All the food was fine but nothing special. The main draw of the restaurant is the novelty. We will not likely go back unless we had guests who insisted on the 'experience'.",3," February 17, 2013"
2339,The food was delicious! The service was top notch everyone working as a team!,5," February 16, 2013"
2340,I would have given the restaurant a better rating if I was actually seated on time for my reservation which I made two weeks ago and if my request was honored to sit at a table with a nice view. Instead we were seated in the furthest corner right by the kitchen with a ton if traffic from waiters and when I asked them if they reviewed my request they said they knew nothing about it because I made the reservation over open table. So maybe this is an issue with open table and not the restaurant but either way I was not thrilled. The food was ok. I didn't love 75 percent of te meat that was served (nothing exceptional just ok) but the salad bar was great. Considering how we paid $50pp I was expecting great. I have no great desire to retur,3," February 16, 2013"
2341,Wonderful location to enjoy a good meal.,4," February 16, 2013"
2342,Delicious and perfect for carnivores! There is so much food combined with the hot and cold salad bar! Service is very attentive!,5," February 16, 2013"
2343,"The meat here is decent and enjoy that its hot when served and ""juicy"". The juice from has stained our clothes each time. When we mention this to server they say no, they wont splash but they do each time. We tried to have them put the meat on a separate plate away from our clothes but some servers refuse to do that.<br/><br/>What I have also experienced is if the MALE has turned their card over to red and the female is still waiting for food, we are never served unless the male at the table turns his card over. And why is it that the male is served more food than the female? The male is offered a second serving while the female is not. Often the male is served first, then the female, and once done carving the server leaves right away.",3," February 15, 2013"
2344,"if you enjoy meat this is a must, if you just ""like"" meat its a bit overkill. I took the better half for Valentines Day (b/c she enjoys trying new restaurants, me I could eat the same thing every night until I die). I was completely overwhelmed but I generally eat only chicken and fish not a huge meat eater she really enjoyed the place. It certainly was interesting including the wait staffs dress as well as energetic (or loud). Not sure I would go back but it was something different and worth checking out once",4," February 14, 2013"
2345,"Fogo is a fun experience for something different and the food is very good and the service as to the meats coming around is great. We had to wait a bit for drinks and dessert, but overall it's a fun place when you want something different than a normal steakhouse.",4," February 13, 2013"
2346,This is basically an upscale buffet and appeals to the Cheesecake Factory crowd---- all you can eat. The food is good but not overwhelming.,3," February 5, 2013"
2347,Classic Brazillian steakhouse. I have been to several others over the years and this was not the best (but certainly had worse) Overall a good experience but definitly a Chain vibe..,3," February 3, 2013"
2348,"The place smelled like a butcher shop. The air coming from the vents has such the same strong smell as well.<br/>The bill took 30"" to come to the table. I was disappointed and the check was outrageous for what we got. I will not come back.",1," February 2, 2013"
2349,They go out of their way to please you .<br/>Salad bar hello !!!! The meat excellent !,5," January 31, 2013"
2350,"This type of dining is not my cup of tea, but was interested in checking it out. Salad bar is nice... very fresh. Service was good. Place too noisy. My idea of dining is more laid back. Tried almost all the meats. The best was the filet, the sliced lamb, not the chops... and liked the pork ribs. Some of the other things were not the best quality IMO or a bit dry. The chicken is was not worth it. Sides were plentiful... liked the fried polenta sticks.<br/><br/>I'd prefer to just order a good entree from a traditional steak house, a few sides and a nice bottle of wine. Like that concept better... you know, like The Palm that was in this location before Fago.",3," January 30, 2013"
2351,"Side dishes were gross, cold. Service was poor.",3," January 27, 2013"
2352,Great everything! It was nice to have our table requests from the reservation honored.,4," January 27, 2013"
2353,Food was good ..however i felt rushed.,4," January 27, 2013"
2354,"Wow! I have been to Brazilian steak houses before and have actually been to Brazil. This place tops it all! Amazing salad bar and perfect meats keep coming and coming. A little pricey, but once in a while it is worth it. Go hungry!",5," January 27, 2013"
2355,great food and awesome service. Bring your appetite!,4," January 25, 2013"
2356,"We have been to many of these types of Brazilian BBQ, but never Fogo. I had heard about the amazing service &amp; food at Fogo. The food, salad bar, meats amazing. Our surly Brazillian waitress that gave attitude the minute we didn't order wine not so much. We had to ask for sides. My daughters had to request water. I had a plate removed, but not another put down. Any server other than our actual waitress was a delight. We just got the bad attitude one. We looked for a manager on the way out, but no discernible manager was visible. The valet parking is terrific, just text for car 10 minutes before done with meal.",3," January 21, 2013"
2357,"Food is good a lit on salty side,. Service is good very attentive. Make u come w a big appetite n loose clothing,",4," January 18, 2013"
2358,Great for lunch but pricey for dinner. But if you can really eat then it is well worth a trip. The food is amazing and the drinks are right on point. all in all for what you get the price is not bad. Just go when you are hungry. IT IS ALOT OF MEAT!<br/><br/>Service is friendly and very good.,4," January 18, 2013"
2359,"I wasn't impressed by the quality of the meats. Maybe only the rib eye, lamb and filet mignon make the cut.<br/>I rather go to a premium steak house than coming back Fogo.",3," January 16, 2013"
2360,Loved everything about Fogo de Chao! I can't wait to go back.,5," January 15, 2013"
2361,Good food and the service is great.,4," January 12, 2013"
2362,Very good selection of perfectly cooked meats carved at your tableside. My only con with the place is the price. It is very expensive making it a special occassion place more then a general night out.,4," January 12, 2013"
2363,It was my husbands birthday and he loves MEAT! This was a great time for a great price all you can eat for $48 you can't go wrong. I was amazed with the salad bar and again all the food options. We will go again!,5," January 11, 2013"
2364,"I am not a fan of any buffet style dining but this was exceptional! The service was great and the salads and sides were impressive. The cheese bread, OH my!",5," January 10, 2013"
2365,"excellent food ( plentiful, well spiced, quality... although should have more of a selection for non red meat eaters ) and service. Restaurant is well run. Will return.",5," January 5, 2013"
2366,"The food is good, but the whole experience feels very rushed. Servers are everywhere running around with skewers of meat, bumping into your chair and constantly interupting you to see if you want more meat. It seems like there is just too much staff; they are evrywhere and constantly, constantly asking if everything is OK. Our server was also constantly pouring our wine, as if he wanted us to drink it down so they could get us out of there and seat another party. The meat is coming so fast that you can't eat it before it gets cold. The server with the after-dinner drink cart came by before we were even finished eating our main course.",2," January 4, 2013"
2367,"We were thrilled to find this establishment had opened in Boston, after having a truly memorable experience at the F.d.C in Philly. The four of us became dizzy while we sampled skewer after skewer of well-prepared meats. This was after a truly amazing buffet of sides and salads. We'll be back!",4," January 3, 2013"
2368,Outstanding venue for any occasion.<br/>Amazingly delicious steaks and salad bar.<br/>The best FDC I have been to :)<br/>And the best service by the crew I've had in any restaurant.,5," January 2, 2013"
2369,The service and food were wonderful. Will definitely come back again.,4," January 1, 2013"
2370,"We have visited a number of Fogos around the country in recent years. Without exception, we were pleased with each visit's food, service and ambiance. The Boston incarnation is relatively new, and it was mostly up to par. A few of the servings were too salty, a sentiment shared by us and a few others. Probably nothing to be too alarmed about unless it wasn't an isolated incident. I've long praised Fogo for offering delicately balanced seasonings. Too much salt would degrade the establishment to that of the faceless (cheap) competitors out there.<br/><br/>Still, our New Year's was memorable, and the taste was (mostly) exquisite.",4," December 31, 2012"
2371,"Great service. Sometimes burned the meat when requesting well done but overall, great selection of meats and wonderful salad bar if there's a vegetarian in your group!",4," December 31, 2012"
2372,The best as usual.:). No one does better steaks.,5," December 29, 2012"
2373,"I've eaten at Fogo de Ch√£o restaurants in other cities and had great experiences, so I was very excited that Fogo is now in Boston. But my enthusiasm was dashed! The wonderful long bar that was there when the Palm restaurant occupied the space is gone, replaced by a tiny barlet right by the cold entrance doors. The dining room felt bleak and drab. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and explained the Fogo experience and dealt well with our numerous requests. But the meat--which is the main reason you come to Fogo's--left a lot to be desired. A lot of it was over-salted, way over-salted. Pretty much everything was over-cooked too. Well-done lovers would be happy, everyone else has to put up with medium-well. Great wine list, tho!",4," December 28, 2012"
2374,"Waiters too busy running around with the meat, often forget to stop by our table. Too pricy for the food that is offered. Salad bar was always crowded, had to force your way to get salad.",1," December 28, 2012"
2375,"We were very excited to try this Brazilian steak house but came away disappointed. While some of the meats are excellent, just as many were tough or didn't taste great. And the value is certainly not there as we paid 4 star prices for a 2.5 star meal.",2," December 27, 2012"
2376,"Food was great, plentiful, and the waiters/servers were always ready to please... There were times where they seemed to be trying to hard to upsell drinks to my kids which was bothersome but i guess if you work for tips that is a neccesary evil. Our table was by the front door so we got hit with a cold breeze regualarly we should have moved as their were more tables available but also wondered why they sat us there. Overall a fun night and to top it off since it was Christmas eve they gave us a brazilian traditional cake as a gift to take home!!",4," December 24, 2012"
2377,The meats were excellent and the service is outstanding. There was always someone to help.,5," December 24, 2012"
2378,"RESTAURANT MA-REVIEW: ""FOGO DE CHAO""<br/><br/>In only a little over a month since it took over the former ""Palm"" space in the Westin Hotel, ""Fogo de Chao"" has become one of the hottest restaurants in town. Everyone from old to young is coming to enjoy this new-to-Boston concept in dining. You enter by going up a winding stone staircase, and enter a beautifully decorated large dining room, centered around an enormous appetizer/salad bar. After being seated, one of the highly trained waiters comes over and explains how the system works. First you go to the appetizer bar and fill your plate with as many of the 30 items that you'ld like. They range from prosciutto, salmon, salami, to various cheeses, salads, and potatoes. Then back at your table, whe",5," December 22, 2012"

2380,"Surprisingly good! One of the best salad bars with high quality and unique items. Service is comprehensive and friendly. And the meat selections are really good. You get your choice of the many offerings of beef, lamb and chicken and waiters unerringly find the exact cut you ask for. Good value for the price.",4," December 19, 2012"
2381,"A very fun place to go with a group, the food and drinks are great. The at-table service of the grilled meats is the main reason to experience this place.",4," December 19, 2012"
2382,Very glad that Fogo de Chao has come to Boston. The food was very well prepared but the service was not up to par with others that I have been to.,4," December 18, 2012"
2383,Great place with terrific attentive service. Unlike many churrasco places the meat was always right there on offer. I have been to others where they seem to disappear when you want the next portion.<br/><br/>The staff was excellent although I understand they did not check us in on our booking.,5," December 18, 2012"
2384,This was my first experience with a Brazilian BBQ restaurant and it was a fun and unique experience. The choices on the salad bar and the table side carved meats were endless and the service was fantastic. One comment on some of the meats that came around when it started getting busy was that they were very rare.,4," December 18, 2012"
2385,Great place but the price of the menu is not written anywhere and the check is a surprise at the end of the meal. Quite expensive!,3," December 17, 2012"
2386,"Disappointed with the service, have been to many Fogo de Chao's and this was the first with poor service. Not sure if it was a one time event or not. Loved the food.",3," December 15, 2012"
2387,Great salad bar. Very expensive for a lot of meat. Most of which is beef and a bit salty. Each variety of beef seemed to taste the same and just have a different texture.,2," December 14, 2012"
2388,Fogo De Chao in Boston is a great place to go if you love meat. Everything was cooked and seasoned wonderfully. I would recommend this to all. The side dishes were good as well.,4," December 13, 2012"
